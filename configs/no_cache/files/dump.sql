If that&#8217;s the case, you can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> now, which will keep the editor you&#8217;re familiar with as the default, even after you upgrade to WordPress 5.0.</p>\n\n<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>\n\n<p>Along with the new block editor, we have a new default theme, called Twenty Nineteen, which takes advantage of the new features the block editor provides.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about Twenty Nineteen in its <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/\">introduction post</a>, and follow along with development over on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Default Themes</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, we couldn&#8217;t release a beautiful new default theme, and leave all of our old ones behind. All the way back to Twenty Ten, we&#8217;ve updated every default them to look good in the new block editor.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a> <strong>A known issue</strong>: the block autocompleter fails for blocks whose names contain  characters in non-Latin scripts.

One of the primary factors for this change is that Gutenberg is nearly ready to be considered for merging into Core, with the goal to complete the merge in v5.0.<br /></p>\n\n<p>To maintain flexibility in the development process the final timelines are not yet determined, allowing work already done for v4.9.9 to be moved to v5.0 if needed. Ensuring that WordPress is compatible with the upcoming PHP 7.3 release is a high priority for the Core team.

These are fixes for issues that don&#8217;t generally fall within larger initiatives. Some of the first improvements that have already been implemented include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unselect markers when copying and pasting the contents of a diff</li>\n<li>Edit a repository’s README from the repository root</li>\n<li>Access your repositories straight from the profile dropdown</li>\n<li>Highlight permalinked comments</li>\n<li>Remove files from a pull request with a button</li>\n<li>Branch names in merge notification emails</li>\n<li>Create new pull requests from your repository’s Pull Requests Page</li>\n<li>Add a teammate from the team discussions page</li>\n<li>Collapse all diffs in a pull request at once</li>\n<li>Copy the URL of a comment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the latest improvements allows repository admins to transfer an issue that has been misfiled to another repository where it belongs. At the moment it only works within the same GitHub organization account. Initial <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/1057741387108560897\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">feedback</a> from users indicates many would appreciate this feature require push permissions, instead of admin permissions, as there are likely more users who can help in the bug tracker with moving issues, setting labels, and closing bugs.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Issue filed in the wrong repo? </p>\n<p>We know your pain!

It&#8217;s taken a lot of courage and bravery for him to do that.

This user wants the image to be aligned to the right. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishing the Task in the Classic Editor</h2>\n<p>The classic editor is essentially one big block. Adding media to a paragraph is as quick as placing the mouse cursor at the beginning of a paragraph, clicking the add new media button, selecting or uploading an image, and choosing its alignment. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mce_6\">Accomplishing the Task in Gutenberg</h2>\n<p>In Gutenberg, each paragraph is a block and each block has its own toolbar. This is important because after writing three paragraphs, you can&#8217;t click on an add media button. Instead, you need to create an image block. </p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve selected an image, you need to move the image block above the paragraph block where you want to insert it. At first, you might try to drag and drop the image into the paragraph but that doesn&#8217;t work. You need to use the up and down arrows or drag the block into position. </p>\n<p>Once the image block is in the correct location, click the align right icon.

Users were regularly inconvenienced with distorted text challenges, street sign puzzles, click requirements, and other actions to prove their humanity. </p>\n<p>v3 offers a marked improvement by detecting bots in the background and returning a score that tells the admin if the interaction is suspicious. It scores traffic with its <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110054961A1/en\">Adaptive Risk Analysis Engine</a> instead of forcing human users to perform interactive challenges. The score can be used three different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a threshold that determines when a user is let through or when further verification needs to be done, i.e. two-factor authentication or phone verification.</li>\n<li>Combine the score with your own signals that reCAPTCHA can’t access, such as user profiles or transaction histories.</li>\n<li>Use the reCAPTCHA score as one of the signals to train your machine learning model to fight abuse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>v3 give site owners more options to customize the thresholds and actions for different types of traffic. The video below explains how it works and the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">developer docs</a> have more information on frontend integration and score interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Site owners can view their traffic in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reCAPTCHA admin console</a>. It also displays a list of all of your sites and what version of the API they are using.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-11-01-at-5.08.11-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The admin console also has a form for registering new sites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-11-01-at-5.09.18-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The WordPress Plugin Directory has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/reCAPTCHA/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of standalone plugins and contact forms</a> that make use of reCAPTCHA in some way. Sites that are already set up to use v2 or the Invisible CAPTCHA, will not automatically update to use v3. There&#8217;s a different signup and implementation process that the site owner has to perform before having it integrated on the site.</p>\n<p>WordPress plugin developers who offer reCAPTCHA will have to decide if they want to update existing plugins to use v3 or package a v3 offering in a new plugin. The reCAPTCHA v1 API was shut down earlier this year in March. Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/google/recaptcha/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reCAPTCHA PHP client library on GitHub</a> is still actively encouraging use of both v2 and v3.

The blocks are hosted on NPM and their assets are served from CloudFlare using <a href=\"https://unpkg.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unpkg.com</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gutenberg-cloud-wp-plugin.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg Cloud&#8217;s online library of blocks is CMS agnostic, offering blocks for both Drupal and WordPress sites, and more CMSs in the future. The service advertises three key benefits for developers who host blocks on Gutenberg Cloud:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wider adoption: Your blocks can be used outside of WP</li>\n<li>Discoverability: Your blocks will pop up in the Cloud Blocks UI</li>\n<li>Faster development: No plugin/SVN needed, just publish to NPM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Frontkom is actively recruiting WordPress developers to add blocks to the cloud to test the process. Documentation for <a href=\"https://github.com/front/cloud-blocks/blob/master/docs/migrate-block.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">migrating blocks from a plugin</a> is available on GitHub. Frontkom has also produced a new <a href=\"https://github.com/front/create-cloud-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">boilerplate generator for building Gutenberg Cloud blocks</a>.</p>\n<p>Users should note that the team is still ironing out the experience for developers adding blocks to the cloud, so the plugin isn&#8217;t yet ready for general use. It&#8217;s currently under active development. </p>\n<h3>WordPress Developers Say Gutenberg Cloud May Not be the Best Way to Release Blocks but Platform has Potential</h3>\n<p>I contacted some WordPress developers who have tested sending their blocks to Gutenberg Cloud to get their initial reactions to the platform. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea that folks will be able to install blocks a la carte is interesting,&#8221; <a href=\"https://coblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> author and ThemeBeans founder Rich Tabor said. &#8220;It’s pretty much as easy as installing plugins.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor experimented with migrating his Block Gallery blocks and said the process was not difficult but he foresees difficulties in maintaining blocks across parent plugins and Gutenberg Cloud.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a developer, I’m still not entirely convinced Gutenberg Cloud is the best way to release blocks, aside from relatively simple blocks,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;I personally lean towards building suites of blocks that share a relative purpose, instead of one plugin (or one Cloud Block instance) per block. For one, it cuts down on maintenance quite a bit, as custom components can be shared between blocks. And there’s much better discoverability on getting relative blocks in the hands of users — if they’re grouped together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Block collections have been criticized for making it difficult to search for and discover individual blocks, but Tabor makes some good arguments for improving block discoverability by grouping together features users often need. That is the whole point of successful plugins like Jetpack, but this type of packaging also lends itself to criticism about bloat.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a similar conundrum when we look at grouped/not grouped shortcode plugins,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;I suppose the main difference is that the nature of blocks is much more complicated than that of shortcodes. History seems to repeat itself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he is considering distributing a few of his free blocks through Gutenberg Cloud but he hasn&#8217;t fully decided yet.</p>\n<p>WordPress core contributor, <a href=\"https://joshpress.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Pollock</a>, who has worked extensively with React and Gutenberg, also tested the Gutenberg Cloud platform. He said he thinks it has a lot of potential for developers who write blocks that are mainly JavaScript already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could see how an agency that builds WordPress sites could save a lot of time and hassle building out a block library,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;As a plugin developer with a lot of little ideas, the pain and time of setting up a block and block environment, which no one has gotten right yet, makes me very excited about this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pollock also reported a positive experience with the <a href=\"https://github.com/front/create-cloud-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create-cloud-block</a> generator.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The code that create-cloud-block generates is well-written, but not too opinionated,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;The developer experience is both really cool &#8212; you preview your block in a functional Gutenberg-powered editor with no WordPress site attached &#8212; and a little frustrating as there is no live reload yet. I know they are just getting started and the tool doesn&#8217;t lock you into any structure, which is great. I&#8217;ll be keeping my eye on this project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom CTO Per André Rønsen said his team will continue testing the cloud internally until they get more developer feedback on the corresponding WordPress plugin. For Drupal users, Gutenberg Cloud will be shipped as a submodule of Gutenberg, which means all sites that install Gutenberg will also get the Cloud module. It can, however, be disabled. Rønsen said his team plans to showcase Gutenberg Cloud for D8 at DrupalCamp Oslo in November.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 23:12:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Matt: What’s in My Bag, 2018 Edition\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48557\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://ma.tt/2018/10/whats-in-my-bag-2018-edition/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12475:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2018/10/bag-v4.jpg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img /></a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://sdrtraveller.com/collections/accessories/products/travel-folio\">SDR Kashmir Travel Folio</a>, made with this super-cool material called Dyneema, which is twice as strong as Kevlar and 15 times as strong as steel, but virtually weightless.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XGD6CS4/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Garmin Forerunner 935</a> which is a triathlon watch, so it can tell me how much I don’t run, how much I don’t bike, and how much I don’t swim.

For many years I had custom in-ear monitors, but the convenience of wireless overcame that, even before they started taking headphone jacks out of phones. Bragi now allows you to send in ear molds from an audiologist and they’ll make these custom true wireless headphones that fit and sound great, but I have trouble recommending because the case is so heavy and once got so jammed I almost thought I’d have to throw the whole thing away, and the app has never been able to “connect” for me because it gets stuck on turning on some fitness sensors. If it could connect I think I could turn off the other feature that is annoying, which is the touch controls that I find get triggered by my hat or when my head is against a chair. So, a qualified “maybe try this.”</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4LBOV6/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Sennheiser Culture Series Wideband Headset</a>, which I use for podcasts, Skype, Facetime, Zoom, and Google Hangout calls with external folks and teams inside of Automattic. Light, comfortable, great sound quality, and great at blocking out background noise so you don’t annoy other people on the call. I’d love to replace this with something wireless but haven’t found one with as high fidelity audio.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07712LKJM/?tag=photomatt08-20\">GL.iNet GL-AR750 Travel AC Router</a> which I use to create wifi networks different places I go, which is often faster than hotel/etc wifi, and I can also VPN encrypt all my traffic through it. Pretty handy! But not user-friendly. Often keep it in my suitcase and not my backpack. I have a retractable Ethernet and micro-USB attached to it.</li>\n<li>Matte black Airpods.

They don’t have anything like it available online right now but it folds up ultra-tiny, weighs nothing, and is a nice layer for on an airplane. My only complaint (as with all Lululemon products) is the low quality of the zipper. (2nd year)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it for this year.

It offers support for multisite as well as several popular plugins, such as ACF, bbPress, BuddyPress, EDD, Gravity Forms, WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, and Jetpack. Stream hasn&#8217;t gained much traction in recent years with just 30,000 active installations. </p>\n<p>In 2014, Stream&#8217;s creators explored offering <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stream as a service</a> where the logs were stored in AWS and included configurable SMS notifications. The service was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shut down in 2015</a> in favor of storing the activity logs locally due to the expense of cloud storage. Shortly after that it was acquired by XWP.</p>\n<p>Automattic is also exploring offering its new Activity feature as a paid service. Currently sites on the Free plan only have access to the last 20 most recent events. Access is tiered based on the plan. Personal and Premium users have access to activities from the last 30 days and Professional users can see all activities for the past year. The ability to filter activities by type is also restricted to paid users only.</p>\n<p>Jetpack site owners should note that Activity is activated by default &#8211; it&#8217;s not a module that can be turned on or off.

The team, largely a group of unpaid volunteers, collaborated on a detailed assessment that publicly challenges Gutenberg&#8217;s readiness for core in a way that no other WordPress team has done through official channels to date. After a week of testing the most recent version of the plugin, the team concluded that they cannot recommend Gutenberg to be used by anyone who relies on assistive technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Accessibility team – like any team in WordPress – has no specific authority over the project. Because we’re a small team of volunteers, we’ve been pragmatic in how we apply the guidelines. We have made tradeoffs in prioritization. Gutenberg is a place where we feel it is necessary to draw a line. The ability to author, edit, and publish posts is the primary purpose of WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Accessibility team rep Joe Dolson, speaking on behalf of the team, cited cognitive load and complexity, inconsistent user interface behavior, heavy reliance on keyboard shortcuts, and difficulties with keyboard navigation through blocks, among other concerns about Gutenberg. He outlined an example of the keyboard sequence required to do something as simple as change the font size in a paragraph block. It currently requires 34 separate keyboard stops, and even more if the tester doesn&#8217;t have prior knowledge of how to navigate Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because the complexity of interaction with Gutenberg is an order of magnitude greater than in the classic editor, we believe that Gutenberg is less accessible than the existing classic editor, though it offers many great features that are not available in the current editor,&#8221; Dolson said. </p>\n<p>This assessment echoes many of the common themes found in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg&#8217;s reviews on WordPress.org</a>, even among the most recent reviews of the latest version. Ratings are currently hovering at 2.3 out of 5 stars. Users have repeatedly said the interface is &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-is-a-clear-winner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">far too heavily reliant on hover based functionality</a>.&#8221; Even those without accessibility needs find it <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/blocks-concept-seems-great-but-still-so-confusing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confusing</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/rage-inducing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unintuitive</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/an-unusable-codewreck/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">difficult to navigate content</a>. Some testers find it <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fixing-what-isnt-broken-w-broken-tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nearly impossible to do what they want to do with it</a>.</p>\n<p>The positive reviews recognize the software as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/much-needed-update-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a work in progress</a> and testers seem more aware of the overall vision for the plugin. They are excited about some of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/my-experience-with-gutenberg-the-good-and-not-so-good/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more advanced features that blocks offer</a>, but many positive reviewers urge WordPress to give it more time before making it the default editor.</p>\n<p>The accessibility team is convinced that the main accessibility issues in Gutenberg stem from design issues. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is the way of the future in WordPress, but the direction it has taken so far has been worrying,&#8221; Dolson said. &#8220;We do not want to miss the opportunity to build a modern and inclusive application for WordPress, but in order to achieve that goal, accessibility needs to incorporated in all design processes in the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These problems are solvable. Retrofitting accessibility is not an effective process. It is costly in terms of time and resources.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a recent post titled <a href=\"https://pento.net/2018/10/26/iterating-on-merge-proposals/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iterating on Merge Proposals</a>, Gary Pendergast, who is leading the merge of Gutenberg into core, acknowledged that they could have asked for the accessibility team&#8217;s help much earlier in the process. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The Accessibility team should’ve been consulted more closely, much earlier in the process, and that’s a mistake I expect to see rectified as the Gutenberg project moves into its next phase after WordPress 5.0,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;While Gutenberg has always aimed to prioritize accessibility, both providing tools to make the block editor more accessible, as well as encouraging authors to publish accessible content, there are still areas where we can improve.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At this time there has been no official response to the accessibility team&#8217;s assessment. It does not look like it will meaningfully impact the release date, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beta 2</a> went out last night and RC 1 is planned for release today. If the core dev chats are any indication, contributors involved in 5.0 seem to be on board with the ambitious timeline for its release. </p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://werdswords.com/accessibility-in-gutenberg-is-not-a-one-more-feature/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accessibility in Gutenberg is not a one-more feature</a>,&#8221; core developer Drew Jaynes urges the project&#8217;s leadership and contributors not to compromise core accessibility standards for the sake of an expedited timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please let&#8217;s not make the &#8216;new standard&#8217; be that we&#8217;re willing to ship technically accessible but perhaps not entirely usable-for-all features; let&#8217;s not define it as one that sacrifices standards core to the WordPress experience in the name of perceived expediency; let&#8217;s not define it as the new default authoring experience for all users when not all users can use it well,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 release lead Matt Mullenweg has frequently said the release will ship when it&#8217;s ready. He contends that the interface has been continually modified for accessibility needs throughout the process of developing Gutenberg. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Modifying the interface to accomodate a11y is the compromise, it has been continuous throughout the process. I don\'t know how to achieve the imaginary bar you\'re setting up.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1055889800119508992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 26, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Matthew MacPherson, Gutenberg&#8217;s accessibility lead, was not immediately available for comment on the team&#8217;s assessment. Ultimately, the decision to delay the release will fall to Mullenweg and his leadership team. The accessibility team, however, will not lend its endorsement of Gutenberg at this time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The accessibility team will continue to work to support Gutenberg to the best of our ability. However, based on its current status, we cannot recommend that anybody who has a need for assistive technology allow it to be in use on any sites they need to use at this time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg is now 20 days away from landing in WordPress 5.0, but this does not leave enough time to solve the design and architectural issues the accessibility team has identified. They have <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44671\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposed a notice</a> on the 5.0 release to inform administrators of Gutenberg&#8217;s inadequacy for users of assistive technology, with a prompt to install the Classic Editor plugin. Many people with accessibility needs depend on the WordPress editor in order to do their work and will need to stick with the old interface. The proposal has been closed with a note indicating that 5.0 will point users to the Classic Editor plugin if they need it.</p>\n<p>The mistake of not having consulted accessibility experts in the design phase cannot be easily rectified at this point, but the Classic Editor is still available for those who need to preserve their same workflow. The conflict lies in whether WordPress should ship a new editor that those with accessibility needs cannot immediately use. It is a somewhat painful and frustrating outcome for those users when the entire ecosystem is rapidly moving towards Gutenberg as the standard. </p>\n<p>Either the accessibility and usability issues the team identified are not as bad as they purport or this document is a last-minute clarion call that could prevent WordPress from shipping an editor that excludes users who rely on assistive technology.

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.0 Beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-beta2.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n<p>WordPress 5.0 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\">November 19</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big issues that we fixed since Beta 1:</p>\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve updated to the latest version of the block editor from the Gutenberg plugin, which includes the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10209\">Format API</a>, embedding improvements, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/milestone/71\">a variety of bug fixes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Meta boxes had a few bugs, and they weren&#8217;t showing at all in the block editor, so we&#8217;ve fixed and polished there.</p>\n\n<h2>Internationalisation</h2>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added support for <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45103\">registering and loading JavaScript translation files</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">Twenty Nineteen repository</a> is a hive of activity, there have been a stack of minor bugs clean up, and some notable additions:</p>\n\n<ul><li>There&#8217;s now a widget area in the page footer.</li><li>Navigation submenus have been implemented for mobile devices.</li><li>Customiser options have been added for changing the theme colours and feature image filters.</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Everything Else</h2>\n\n<p>The REST API has a couple of bug fixes and performance improvements.

The event is dedicated to uniting the PHP community and will be held November 14-15, 2018, in Washington, D.C. </p>\n<p>This year the organizing team created a &#8220;Content Advisory Board&#8221; to ensure the event included sessions that will appeal to everyone. The board includes two WordPress Developers, two Drupal developers, and two more more general PHP developers. They reviewed all incoming talk submissions and gave organizers ideas on what they thought would be of greatest interest to each community.</p>\n<p>php[world] has traditionally included several topics and speakers from the WordPress world. This year the program features a full-day training workshop on Gutenberg development led by Josh Pollock and Zac Gordon. The workshop is called <a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/modern-wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of WordPress Development</a> and is available through a <a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/register/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">separate day ticket</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always tried to focus php[world] on being the PHP conference that appeals to WordPress and Drupal developers as well,&#8221; conference co-chair Eli White said.  &#8220;We all write PHP (and JavaScript) code, and the DC area is full of WordPress and Drupal development shops. In fact, the majority of people in the local PHP user groups are doing WordPress development anyway. So we should all just be learning from each other. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For WordPress, that was obviously Gutenberg. Currently the release date for WordPress 5.0 and Gutenberg is November 19th, just a few days after php[world], and so it&#8217;s a really important topic for any developer who works with WordPress to be familiar with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Workshop attendees can expect to become better acquainted with extending Gutenberg. The instructors plan to cover the basics of block creation as well as more advanced topics like making blocks dynamic and creating advanced blocks with the WordPress REST API and Redux.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the workshop, our goal is to get folks comfortable with what they could do with Gutenberg,&#8221; Josh Pollock said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll cover the anatomy of a block, and different patterns for creating simple and complex blocks. We&#8217;ll go over each of the types of block types you can create and have hands-on time to play with these new skills and ask real time questions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Developers should leave with an understanding of the different types of blocks they can build and why. They&#8217;ll also get plenty of example code, links, and advice they can use when it&#8217;s time to build blocks for their own WordPress projects.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The event includes a few other sessions geared towards WordPress developers: David Wolfpaw is giving a workshop called &#8220;<a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/building-wordpress-themes-a-primer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Building WordPress Themes: A Primer</a>&#8221; and Mo Jangda from Automattic is giving a talk on &#8220;<a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/handle-an-outage/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Handle a Site Outage</a>.&#8221; There is another full-day training on modern PHP security that happens the day before the Gutenberg workshop that White said the WordPress Developers on the content board urged them to include.</p>\n<p>The main conference is also hosting many sessions that would benefit WordPress developers who want to sharpen their PHP skills.

It&#8217;s a minor update that has been in development since May and began testing in September. The release should be backwards compatible to version 3.0 of the plugin but users are always advised to test all of their themes and extensions before updating.</p>\n<p>Store owners can expect to see a change in the copy of the default transactional emails. They have been <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/21288\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated to be friendlier and more human</a>. This is particularly important for the customer-facing emails. All of the following have been updated: on-hold, processing, completed, refunded both full and partially, invoice both with a pending and non-pending status, customer notes, password reset, new account. The default content in the store admin emails has also been improved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/payment-received.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The WooCommerce team anticipates that the updates to the transactional emails will reduce the need for store owners to customize their email templates. It also gives customers a better, friendlier connection to the store. More updates to the email content editing experience are planned for 2019. </p>\n<p>Store owners may also benefit from the new option to set a low stock threshold in the inventory tab for individual products, export products by category to the CSV exporter, and define custom product placeholder images that will resize to correct store aspect ratio. </p>\n<p>The WooCommerce REST API continues to evolve with v3 introduced in this release. It adds new endpoints required for the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/wc-admin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wc-admin feature plugin</a>, the React-powered WooCommerce admin interface that was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-new-woo-adopts-gutenberg-components-user-interface-driven-by-react\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">featured at last week&#8217;s WooSesh</a>. REST API v3 also adds new features to existing endpoints while maintaining backwards compatibility with legacy API versions.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.5 introduces support for the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-custom-product-tables-plugin-now-in-beta-boasts-30-faster-page-loads\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Product Tables feature plugin</a>, which is being developed to improve store performance and scalability. In some cases storing product data in custom tables has brought <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/woocommerce-custom-product-tables-beta/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30% faster page loads</a>. </p>\n<p>In version 3.5 the &#8220;Preview Changes&#8221; button was <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/20650\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">removed from the publish meta box when editing products</a>.

McAlister has been developing WordPress themes since 2009. He initially sold his themes on ThemeForest. In 2011, he founded Array Themes.</p>\n<p>I reached out to McAlister to learn why he chose to be acquired, what excites him most about Gutenberg, and what the plans are going forward.</p>\n<h2>Interview with Mike McAlister</h2>\n<h4><strong>What ultimately made you decide to move on from managing your own theme and products company to a larger, more established company?</strong></h4>\n<p>The catalyst was when Brian Gardner reached out this summer and started a conversation about joining his team at <a href=\"https://wpengine.com\">WP Engine</a>. As I told him at the time, he certainly wasn&#8217;t the first to make that offer, but he was definitely the most interesting. I had always respected Brian&#8217;s ethos on quality and design and really enjoyed our chats over the years.</p>\n<p>Once I started meeting folks at WP Engine like Jason Cohen and David Vogelpohl, it became obvious that we were all striving for the same future and outcome for customers. It just made sense to join forces to make it happen together.</p>\n<p>This was also a unique opportunity for me to start fresh and focus on crafting products with a stellar team. Although I was able to create an industry-respected theme collection and recently the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\">Atomic Blocks</a> plugin for Gutenberg, I wanted a new challenge. </p>\n<h4><strong>Couldn&#8217;t Array Themes have been built to directly support the Genesis framework without being acquired by WP Engine?</strong></h4>\n<p>It would be a lot of work to infuse the Array Themes collection and Genesis. The idea wasn&#8217;t exactly to bring Genesis to Array, rather to bring the expertise and craft of Array and Atomic Blocks to WP Engine, StudioPress and Gutenberg. </p>\n<p>StudioPress already has one of the biggest and best theme collections out there and is doubling down on Gutenberg support. I&#8217;m going to contribute what I&#8217;ve learned building Array Themes and Atomic Blocks to make the StudioPress offering even better.</p>\n<h4><strong>Will future themes require the Genesis framework?</strong></h4>\n<p>Although there will not be any new themes released under the Array Themes brand, some of the designs will live on as <a href=\"https://my.studiopress.com/themes/\">StudioPress themes</a> in the future and those will be powered by the Genesis framework. </p>\n<p>We&#8217;re working on some really exciting new themes and features for Genesis that are going to continue making it the go-to solution for creating beautiful websites on WordPress, especially in the Gutenberg era.</p>\n<h4><strong>What do you think of the consolidation of brands in the WordPress space?</strong></h4>\n<p>We&#8217;re seeing a very unique and transitional time in the WordPress industry. The old way of doing things is going out the window as WordPress and its community changes before our eyes. </p>\n<p>Now, more than ever, WordPress needs companies with stellar talent to help usher it through to the next era and contribute to its long term success. I&#8217;m excited to be part of a team that is willing to take on that challenge!</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t speak to the motivations of other businesses in the WordPress space, but the WP Engine acquisition of the Array product suite makes a lot of sense. </p>\n<p>With their recent acquisition of StudioPress, Array Themes, and Atomic Blocks, WP Engine is showing its customers and the WordPress community that they are doubling down on quality, design, Gutenberg, and an unmatched customer experience. These are all shared qualities between these individual entities and part of the long term strategy at WP Engine.</p>\n<h4><strong>What excites you most about Gutenberg?</strong></h4>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been excited about Gutenberg for over a year now. I was one of the first WordPress product developers to release a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\">blocks plugin</a>, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/atomic-blocks/\">Gutenberg-friendly theme</a>, <a href=\"https://atomicblocks.com/blog/\">a blog with tutorials</a>, and the <a href=\"http://gutenberg.news/\">Gutenberg News</a> site. </p>\n<p>I created all of these resources as a way of learning Gutenberg as well as contributing back to the community, and I will continue to do that with WP Engine and StudioPress!</p>\n<p>Gutenberg unlocks the WordPress editor and the endless opportunities that follow for content creators, developers, and everyone in between.

Thanks to the flexibility that this model offers, folks have been able to iterate rapidly on a wide range of features, touching just about every part of WordPress.</p>\n\n<p>The &#8220;Features as Plugins&#8221; idea was first introduced during the WordPress 3.7 development cycle, during which the features were merged after a short discussion during a core chat: it was only in the WordPress 3.8 cycle that the idea of a merge proposal post (called &#8220;Present Your Feature&#8221; back then) came into being. It was envisioned as a way to consult with WordPress leaders, key contributors, and the wider WordPress community on the readiness of this feature to be released. Ultimately, WordPress leaders would make a decision on whether the feature was right for WordPress, and the release lead would decide if it was ready for that release.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, most feature plugins have published some form of merge proposal post before they were ultimately merged into WordPress, and they&#8217;ve nearly all benefited to some degree from this process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">The merge proposal process has worked well for smaller features, but it struggled with larger changes.</p>\n\n<p>The REST API is a great example of where the merge proposal process didn&#8217;t work. The REST API was a significant change, and trying to communicate the scope of that change within the bounds of a single merge proposal post didn&#8217;t really do it justice. It was impossible to convey everything that was changing, how it all worked together, and what it meant for WordPress.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;d go so far as to say that the shortcomings of the merge proposal process are at least partially responsible for why the REST API hasn&#8217;t seen the level of adoption we&#8217;d hoped for. It&#8217;s managed to gain a moderate amount of popularity with WordPress development agencies, and a handful of plugins use it in some ways, but it never really entered into mainstream usage in the ways it could&#8217;ve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">In a project that prides itself on being willing to try new ideas, the merge proposal process has remained largely static for many years.</p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg is the first opportunity since the REST API was merged where we can examine the shortcomings of the merge proposal process, and see how we can apply the original intent of it to the Gutenberg project&#8217;s scope and long term vision.</p>\n\n<h2>Merge Consultation</h2>\n\n<p>Over the last six months, Gutenberg project leads have been consulting with teams across the WordPress project. Helping them get involved when they didn&#8217;t have any Gutenberg experience, explaining how their focus fit into the vision for Gutenberg, and listening to feedback on where things needed to be improved. In many circumstances, this consultation process has been quite successful: the WordPress Media and REST API teams are great examples of that. Both teams have got up to speed on the Gutenberg project, and have provided their valuable experience to make it even better.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s been entirely successful. There&#8217;s been a lot of discussion about Gutenberg and Accessibility recently, much of it boils down to what <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2018/10/some-gutenberg-accessibility-clarifications/\">Joe Dolson summarised</a> as being &#8220;too little, too late&#8221;. He&#8217;s correct, the Accessibility team should&#8217;ve been consulted more closely, much earlier in the process, and that&#8217;s a mistake I expect to see rectified as the Gutenberg project moves into its next phase after WordPress 5.0. While Gutenberg has always aimed to prioritise accessibility, both <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/18/regarding-accessibility-in-gutenberg/\">providing tools to make the block editor more accessible, as well as encouraging authors to publish accessible content</a>, there are still areas where we can improve.</p>\n\n<p>While there&#8217;s much to be discussed following WordPress 5.0, we can already see now that different teams needed to be consulted at different points during the project. Where Gutenberg has aimed to consult with teams earlier than a previous feature plugin would&#8217;ve, we need to push that further, ensuring that teams are empowered to get involved earlier still in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">All feature plugins in the future, great and small, will benefit from this iteration.</p>\n\n<p>Creating a framework for more fluid feedback over the entire lifecycle of a feature project is beneficial for everyone. WordPress teams can ensure that their feedback is taken on board at the right time, project leads gain experience across the broad range of teams that work on WordPress, and projects themselves are able to produce a better resulting feature.</p>\n\n<p>They important thing to remember throughout all of this is that everything is an experiment. We can try an approach, discover the weaknesses, and iterate. We&#8217;re all only human, we all make mistakes, but every mistake is an opportunity to ensure the same mistake can&#8217;t happen again. Sometimes that means changing the software, and sometimes that means changing the processes that help build the software. Either way, we&#8217;re always able to iterate further, and make WordPress fun for everyone. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 03:30:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 335 – Introduction to BigCommerce with Topher DeRosia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=85070&preview=true&preview_id=85070\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-335-introduction-to-bigcommerce-with-topher-derosia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1798:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/\">Topher DeRosia</a>, a developer evangelist for <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/\">BigCommerce</a>. DeRosia introduces what BigCommerce is, why users and developers should take a look at it, and why they&#8217;re making a big push into the WordPress space.

The organization is a community of more than 800 web professionals, educators, and others who work with WordPress in higher education. WPCampus director Rachel Cherry <a href=\"https://wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a request for proposals</a> detailing the organization&#8217;s specific concerns:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our organization is sensitive to the legal requirements set by <a href=\"https://section508.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a>. The recent 508 refresh brought these requirements in line with <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WCAG 2.0 level AA</a>, an industry standard that helps ensure accessibility. WCAG 2.0 is also <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commonly used as a baseline for policies</a> governing many WPCampus participants outside the United States, with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/09/wcag-2-1-adoption-in-europe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European Union already moving to WCAG 2.1</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The audit is aimed at determining potential legal risk for institutions upgrading to WordPress 5.0 and will also identify specific challenges that Gutenberg introduces for assistive technology users and others with accessibility needs.</p>\n<p>WPCampus is funding the audit and is not soliciting contributions from the community at this time. However, Pagely has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pagely/status/1055289065883365377\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">offered to donate $1,000 to the organization</a> in order to offset the costs of the audit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Contributions wise, at this point, we’d love for folks to share to help ensure we receive a wide variety of proposals,&#8221; Cherry said. WPCampus will publish the results of the audit to share with the greater WordPress community. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond our institutions’ legal obligations, colleges and universities worldwide have committed to providing an accessible digital experience to their diverse communities,&#8221; Cherry said. &#8220;This is consistent with the broader culture of higher education, which values inclusivity and an exchange of ideas free from artificial barriers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While the WordPress accessibility coding standards require new code to meet WCAG 2.0 AA, the new editor has not received a full accessibility audit. Lacking such an audit, the overall accessibility of Gutenberg is unclear. This makes it difficult for colleges and universities to determine the best course of action once WordPress 5.0 is released with Gutenberg as the default editor.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Accessibility Team is Preparing a Statement on Gutenberg&#8217;s Current Level of Accessibility</h3>\n<p>Accessibility has been one of the most pressing concerns regarding Gutenberg&#8217;s readiness for the world. The accessibility team met Monday and established a new weekly meeting time:&nbsp;15:00 UTC on Fridays. They discussed a communication plan for&nbsp;Gutenberg accessibility feedback, particularly in regards to&nbsp;Matthew<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/19/call-for-testers-community-gutenberg-accessibility-tests/\"> MacPherson&#8217;s call for accessibility testing</a> on the plugin. User testing was conducted in March but a lot has changed since then. MacPherson has called for another round of tests from the community after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-accessibility-audit-postponed-indefinitely\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic decided to forego his proposed independent audit</a> on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>The discussion became somewhat contentious after Gutenberg phase 2 lead Riad Benguella urged the accessibility team not to make its assessment in comparison to the classic editor but instead look at the larger picture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is meant for the whole site editing (even if it’s not at the moment) which means it’s the customizer + editor + menus + widgets at the same time,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;Just compare apples to apples, please, and if you see Gutenberg as an editor, you missed it. For the sake of iteration, it’s being shipped as an editor for now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several members of the accessibility team took issue with statement because Gutenberg will replace the classic editor in WordPress 5.0 (even if users can bring it back with a plugin).</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is <em>crucial</em> we compare these two experiences, because the one completely replaces the other,&#8221; Joe Dolson said. &#8220;It doesn’t matter that the new editor aims to do a lot more, it still must accomplish the same tasks effectively.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Amanda Rush, a blind WordPress user and accessibility specialist, concurred with Dolson&#8217;s assessment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As someone trying to use Gutenberg as it currently stands with a screen reader, I promise you that future goals for the project are the absolute furthest thing away from my brain at the time,&#8221; Rush said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let’s put it this way. Imagine that you are someone who must use assistive technology, or is otherwise reliant on something to do with Accessibility, and you have Gutenberg in front of you and you are trying to accomplish a task. Right now, the only task you can accomplish is writing or editing a post. So, as you are becoming more and more frustrated with the state of things, and trying to get your work done at the same time, imagine what it would be like if someone walked up to you in the middle of this frustrating experience and said well, if you’re calling as an editor you’ve missed it. Because this is going to be so much more than that. That is completely useless, doesn’t have any bearing on what you were trying to accomplish at the time, and promises, whether fairly or not, just more frustration down the road.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-beta-1-now-available-for-testing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beta 1</a> has arrived before the next round of accessibility testing has been completed, and Gutenberg has only recently arrived at UI freeze within the last week. The accessibility team is collaborating on a detailed article with a general and professional statement on the level of overall accessibility in Gutenberg. They plan to publish the statement on Friday.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, WPCampus has taken it upon themselves to spearhead an independent audit to determine if Gutenberg is in compliance with the industry standard WCAG 2.0 level AA, a standard which the accessibility team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adopted as a requirement for all new or updated code released in WordPress</a>. WPCampus&#8217; submission deadline for proposals is November 7, and the organization will select a vendor by November 30. The goal is to release the audit no later than January 17, 2019. </p>\n<p>The timeline WPCampus has identified would not deliver results in time to meaningfully impact WordPress 5.0&#8217;s release date. As Gutenberg has already been merged into core, it seems neither the accessibility team&#8217;s assessment nor an independent third-party audit would be considered a factor in delaying the release. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal with the timeline is to allow adequate time to do it right,&#8221; Cherry said. </p>\n<p>The WordPress community has responded positively to this independent effort to get more information on Gutenberg&#8217;s accessibility issues. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited for this process as an example of how the community can tackle large tasks like this in creative ways,&#8221; Jeremy Felt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyfelt/status/1055176432861634560\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to WPCampus&#8217; taking the initiative to get an audit. &#8220;It also has an opportunity to provide great insight and instruction on the accessibility of a complex React application with many interacting pieces.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/accessibility?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#accessibility</a> audit, spearheaded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpcampusorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@wpcampusorg</a>, is exciting.

Many in the community have expressed concern that if WordPress 5.0 ships a critically inaccessible new editor, it will be violating both its stated mission and its standards.</p>\n<p>A great deal of friction has surrounded Gutenberg&#8217;s journey towards becoming an accessible tool for millions of users. The struggle has highlighted areas where the WordPress project can improve its collaboration across teams.

However, one positive outcome is that the company is now looking to <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/product-designer-accessibility/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hire a product designer who specializes in accessibility</a>. </p>\n<p>Rian Rietveld&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-lead-resigns-cites-political-complications-related-to-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">resignation from the accessibility team</a> was a great loss for the project but it served as a catalyst to bring more visibility to the efforts of WordPress&#8217; accessibility contributors. WPCampus&#8217; initiative to get an accessibility audit for Gutenberg is one example of how the community is rallying around the accessibility team and working to help make the new editor a success for all users, including those with accessibility needs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 19:53:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.0 Beta 1 Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-beta-1-now-available-for-testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2404:\"<p>WordPress 5.0 is marching forward with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-1/\">beta 1 released</a> this evening.

Gutenberg is now considered feature complete as of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/19/whats-new-in-gutenberg-19th-october/\">4.1 release</a>.

In September, Pendergast <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1537994851000100\">said</a> &#8220;the Gutenberg leads are ultimately responsible for the merge proposal&#8221; but the timeline was still to be determined.

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version, and if you are using an existing test site be sure to update the Gutenberg plugin to v4.1. </p>\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.0 beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n<p>WordPress 5.0 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\">November 19</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<h2>The Block Editor</h2>\n\n<p>The new Gutenberg block editor is now the default post editor!</p>\n\n<p>The block editor provides a modern, media-rich editing experience. You can create flexible, beautiful content without writing a single line of code, or you can dive into the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\">modern programming APIs</a> that the block editor provides.</p>\n\n<p>Even before you install WordPress 5.0, you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">try the block editor here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, we recognise you might not be ready for this change quite yet. If that&#8217;s the case, you can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> now, which will keep the editor you&#8217;re familiar with as the default, even after you upgrade to WordPress 5.0.</p>\n\n<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>\n\n<p>Along with the new block editor, we have a new default theme, called Twenty Nineteen, which takes advantage of the new features the block editor provides.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about Twenty Nineteen in its <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/\">introduction post</a>, and follow along with development over on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Default Themes</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, we couldn&#8217;t release a beautiful new default theme, and leave all of our old ones behind. All the way back to Twenty Ten, we&#8217;ve updated every default them to look good in the new block editor.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a> <strong>A known issue</strong>: the block autocompleter fails for blocks whose names contain  characters in non-Latin scripts.

It allowed attendees to view the schedule, venue map, create bookmarks for sessions, and provided offline access in case of network failure. Attendees could add the app to their home screens and opt to receive push notifications for important updates about the event.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the PWA was not ready to be scaled for use at other WordCamps across the community, but <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/10/23/progressive-web-app-for-wordcamps/\">volunteers from the WCEU organizing team are working towards that goal</a>.&nbsp; The app was originally built using React on the frontend and was hosted on a node server. It used WordPress for content management on the backend, along with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pwa/\">WordPress PWA</a>&nbsp;plugin and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/onesignal-free-web-push-notifications/\">OneSignal Push Notifications</a>. The team working on scaling the app for use at other WordCamps is still debating the technologies they will use moving forward.</p>\n<p>Hugh Lashbrooke <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/10/23/progressive-web-app-for-wordcamps/\">posted</a> about the app&#8217;s progress and invited the community to contribute to <a href=\"https://github.com/wceu/pwa\">WCEU&#8217;s PWA repository</a> on GitHub.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The next stage in the process is for the WCEU Design team to create some designs and wireframes for what the app could look like, posting them for feedback,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;We will keep posting updates here as things progress; for now it would be helpful to gather some input from other WordCamp organizers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lashbrooke said the goal is that each WordCamp site will have its own PWA so the app is unique for each camp. Since it loads in a mobile browser, it doesn&#8217;t require additional app installations.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, one of the collaborators on the <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/pwa-wp/\">PWA for WordPress</a> feature plugin, emphasized in the comments that the PWA should not be separate from the main site and that users need not even know about the app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After all, a PWA is just a website,&#8221; Ruter said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;A PWA does not have to be installed to their homescreen to take advantage of PWA capabilities. They just continue go to their WordCamp website as they do normally, except that it also works when they are offline. The interactive schedule is important, but it’s not really PWA territory: rather it’s just a JavaScript component used on a page.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter encouraged those working on the app to view it as a progressive enhancement on top of the existing WordCamp sites, not an entirely separate application. Ideally it will use the same style and theme used on the main website.</p>\n<p>Lashbrooke asked for developers and WordCamp organizers to leave feedback and feature requests in the comments of his <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/10/23/progressive-web-app-for-wordcamps/\">post</a>. Requests submitted so far include a &#8220;you are here&#8221; feature and the capability for users to log in with their WordPress.org account to sync schedule favorites across devices. Not every feature request will make it into the first version, but the team will consult the list for future versions of the project.</p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:08:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: New Plugin Adds Elementor Templates as Gutenberg Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84998\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-elementor-templates-as-gutenberg-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5217:\"<p>One of the most pressing concerns for users in the Gutenberg era is how page builder plugins will respond. Speculation about the new editor &#8220;killing off page builders&#8221; has run rampant, but these plugins are slowly evolving ahead of Gutenberg&#8217;s imminent inclusion in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n<p>In February, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor</a>, one of WordPress&#8217; most popular page builders, <a href=\"https://elementor.com/blog/upcoming-elementor-v2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the plugin would be completely compatible with Gutenberg beginning with its 2.0 version that was released a few months later. Like many other plugins, that meant a nominal compatibility without any custom blocks built specifically for the new editor.</p>\n<p>This week marks a major milestone for the page builder, as Elementor <a href=\"https://elementor.com/blog/blocks-for-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> its new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-builder/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Blocks for Gutenberg</a> plugin. The plugin goes beyond basic compatibility, allowing users to insert any Elementor template into Gutenberg with one click. Its custom block functions as a pipeline to the Elementor library, pulling in content and designs the user has already created in the Elementor interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-23-at-9.29.14-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Elementor Blocks for Gutenberg lets users compose with the new editor while maintaining convenient access to items designed in the page builder. It makes it possible to bring more advanced layouts into Gutenberg and preview them inside the editor. Users can select from more than 300+ pre-designed blocks and 100+ pre-designed pages. The plugin will eventually be incorporated into Elementor&#8217;s core plugin.</p>\n<p>The availability of this new plugin demonstrates Elementor&#8217;s commitment to evolving with WordPress as it adopts the editor and tackles customization in Phase 2. The page builder has more than a million active installations and a 4.8-star average on WordPress.org. Achieving this level of success in the page builder market has required a certain level of tenacity and perseverance. Elementor CMO Ben Pines made it clear their product is not going to be sidelined by Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Elementor was launched in a saturated market, with many page builder and website builder alternatives,&#8221; Pines said. &#8220;We managed to become the leaders of our market by offering the best solution, and we plan to continue to lead the way. We will continue in our mission in full collaboration with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Elementor and Gutenberg share similar goals in helping WordPress users design their websites without having to touch the code. Pines also emphasized the benefits for developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Elementor, Gutenberg, and the veer towards code-free website customization, presents a huge improvement for developers,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of being tied up in endless menial tasks like button or headline customization, and having to hand-hold the designer every step of the process – developers can now focus on greater challenges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This improvement creates a positive loop. Developers have time to build more tools, which in turn help the designers workflow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other popular page builder plugins, like <a href=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/theme-releases/divi-feature-update-introducing-initial-gutenberg-support\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Divi Builder</a> (500k+ installs) and <a href=\"https://kb.wpbeaverbuilder.com/article/588-how-beaver-builder-works-with-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beaver Builder</a> (500k+ installs), have announced initial support for Gutenberg but in both instances this constitutes a button that lets users toggle between the builder and the new editor.</p>\n<p>Elementor is leading the way among page builders by making its content available inside Gutenberg. It essentially builds in an extra step so users can continue with their existing workflow in the page builder and insert those designs into the new editor.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg&#8217;s current customization capabilities pale in comparison to what popular page builders offer, but phase 2 of the project may precipitate another avalanche of blocks pouring into the WordPress ecosystem &#8211; the same way it did after Gutenberg&#8217;s roadmap was unveiled in June at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>Page builders may not reproduce all of their exiting features in custom blocks until WordPress core is more advanced on its road to Gutenberg-powered customization. This would split the creation interface across two admin screens. At some point users may want to see a deeper integration between the editor and page building capabilities. The exciting thing about Elementor&#8217;s new blocks plugin is that its users don&#8217;t have to choose between Gutenberg and their favorite page builder.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 03:58:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: Upcase Developer Learning Platform is Now Free\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84859\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/upcase-developer-learning-platform-is-now-free\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1943:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/upcase-thoughtbot.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com/upcase\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Upcase</a>, a subscription learning platform for developers, is now free and open to the public.

The Genesis community has nothing to worry about when the new editor launches in WordPress 5.0, because <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/gutenberg-believe-in-beauty-of-dreams/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">StudioPress has already made its framework and themes Gutenberg-ready</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With regards to Genesis, the good news is that it has no substantial backwards-compatibility issues with Gutenberg,&#8221; WP Engine CTO Jason Cohen said. &#8220;The main focus of updates to the StudioPress themes are focused on adding styles for the new Gutenberg blocks. However, what we’re most excited about are the brand new features we will be adding to Genesis and the StudioPress themes, that Gutenberg helps enable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said the Genesis community can expect their entire product line to become Gutenberg-first themes that add new features to enhance users&#8217; experience in the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond just being &#8216;compatible,&#8217; Genesis will play a big role in being Gutenberg-First,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;That means not only supporting the software and ideals of Gutenberg, but using them for new features. In doing so, it’s our intention to light the way for the countless agencies and developers who use WordPress to fuel incredible digital experiences that are made even easier with Gutenberg.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said WP Engine will update all StudioPress themes to include additional features for Gutenberg once the new editor launches in WordPress 5.0. If the release stays on its current schedule, users can expect to see 5.0 on November 19.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 22:41:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Team Addresses Accessibility Concerns, Highlights Tools and Features that Surpass the Classic Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84857\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:130:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-team-addresses-accessibility-concerns-highlights-tools-and-features-that-surpass-the-classic-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8021:\"<p>The Gutenberg team has officially <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/18/regarding-accessibility-in-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">responded to recent concerns about the new editor&#8217;s accessibility</a>. Matias Ventura, the project&#8217;s technical lead, published a post with examples of the accessibility efforts the team has made, many which may not be easy to discover. These include features such as keyboard shortcuts, slash command and insertion, high-contrast mode, and mechanisms for navigating regions and blocks with the keyboard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/keyboard-shortcuts.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Ventura highlighted the audible messages feature that works with screen readers and posted a demo of the fully automated end-to-end testing. It allows contributors to test a sequence of operations with the keyboard (without mouse controls). He also identified several fixes landing in the next releases, including accessibility improvements to the date and color picker features, block navigation, and better focus management.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A large amount of work and effort has gone in building mechanisms necessary to make the editor accessible for a wide user base,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;For example, it is entirely possible right now to recreate the &#8216;demo post&#8217; that comes with the Gutenberg plugin using the keyboard. In many ways, these tools are better and more sophisticated than what we offer in the current editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although 270 accessibility-specific tickets have been closed to date, Ventura acknowledged there are still more than 90 remaining. &#8220;The goal is to make this experience as seamless as possible for all users,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Early reactions to the post do not dispute that accessibility work has been done but concerns about Gutenberg&#8217;s overall complexity remain. Fixing this may not be as simple as targeting isolated interactions in the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to continue to develop close feedback loops with different users interacting through their preferred tools to make sure what we build is relevant to their experiences,&#8221; Ventura said. Throughout the process of building and testing Gutenberg, contributors have referenced &#8220;short feedback loops,&#8221; an agile process term that seems to make its way into these conversations.</p>\n<p>However, the frequent built-in checkpoints don&#8217;t seem to have served accessibility needs well, as the accessibility team in convinced that having their input much earlier in the design process would have made a bigger difference further downstream.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve been begging for React development assistance focused on accessibility since the beginning,&#8221; Accessibility specialist Joe Dolson said in a post addressing what he perceives to be <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2018/10/some-gutenberg-accessibility-clarifications/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">common myths about Gutenberg&#8217;s accessibility</a>. &#8220;None of us were already primarily JavaScript-focused, let alone React-focused, and with limited time (spread across Gutenberg, the rest of WordPress, all of the WordPress sites themselves, and theme concerns), managing to keep up with the breakneck pace of development was never feasible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress core contributor John James Jacoby commented on Ventura&#8217;s post, calling attention to the complexity of the interface for all users, including those with and without accessibility needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My concern is that many of the above things do not really improve accessibility in the broader sense,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;Instead, they make a complex user interface more complicated by littering the landscape with hidden keyboard shortcuts that are likely to be undiscoverable by regular-bodied folks, let alone folks who lack dexterity in their hands or fingers or eyes to find/understand/navigate/enjoy them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are users who demand a semantically simpler application to get their jobs done. Though they’re used to quickly navigating the useless mixed-up garbage-markup soup that comes from web development as a whole, it doesn’t help to add extra &#8216;accessibility-centric&#8217; approaches – we should be making the existing approaches accessible first, and adding new approaches after.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dolson echoes that sentiment in his recent post. &#8220;Where Gutenberg falls down is on the overall use of the system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even though most individual interactions are handled effectively, the overall complexity of the system creates an enormous barrier to users if they are keyboard dependent or using a screen reader.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The community has advocated for a myriad of different needs and wishes during the course of Gutenberg&#8217;s development, but any interface created for the millions of people that WordPress aims to serve will inevitably have to deliver some compromises. Matt Mullenweg answered the feedback regarding complexity from his perspective as the project lead:</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think that the current interface could be a ton more streamlined, but we’ve compromised a lot of the alternative approaches we’ve wanted to take based on accessibility feedback and trying to have a single interface that serves all types of users,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If we branched, it would be a different discussion and possibly serve multiple audiences better. There’s a lot of FUD though, ie, that’s going to be illegal in EU.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura&#8217;s post is tightly focused on Gutenberg&#8217;s existing accessibility features and makes no mention of the audit that would have measured if it meets <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; own stated accessibility standards</a>. These standards require that all new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA. Without an examination of how the product meets these standards, much of the the discussion revolves around subjective opinions about complexity. It&#8217;s difficult to quantify issues like cognitive overload.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is entirely possible that Gutenberg will come within a hair of passing WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.0 at level AA at release, but still be inaccessible,&#8221; Dolson said. &#8220;This is because the micro-interactions are being managed well but the macro-interactions are not. This is a flaw with using WCAG 2.0 as a standard; it does not handle address large scale issues effectively. The cognitive load inherent in the current navigation requirements for assistive technology is overwhelming, and that is an accessibility issue – just not one effectively reflected in our current standards requirements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the myths Dolson&#8217;s post dispelled is that the Gutenberg team doesn’t care about accessibility. Ventura&#8217;s post calls attention what he believes to be &#8220;a significant volume of accessibility-specific tools and functionalities&#8221; in Gutenberg that surpass those of the Classic Editor. The team has worked hard to address accessibility concerns but needs better communication across teams in order to continue serving the wider community of WordPress users with accessibility needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There have been a lot of issues on the way that could have been avoided if a React developer had been available to assist with significant dedicated time earlier than 6 weeks before the proposed release; but those were issues coming from ignorance, not a lack of compassion,&#8221; Dolson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t know what Gutenberg will be at release.

Pinchas shared a wealth of data from a survey that was sent to WooCommerce users and to end the presentation, Hoffman described how the team designed the new interfaces.</p>\n<p>One of the major changes <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/wc-admin/\">coming to WooCommerce</a> is a redesigned backend. The project is being developed on GitHub as a feature plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/wc-admin\">WC-Admin</a>.</p>\n<img />New WooCommerce Dashboard\n<p>The dashboard is a landing page where store owners will be able to see at a glance how their store is doing. The new interface is powered by the React JavaScript framework, specifically the React components that are part of the Gutenberg project. It&#8217;s modular, allowing users to add, move, and remove blocks. Developers will be able to extend the dashboard and provide custom blocks.</p>\n<p>In addition to the new interface, reports are being overhauled. Store owners will be able to filter data, compare date records, have easy access to important data points, and download reports in CSV format. The Activity Panel has been completely redesigned and will be accessible from any page in the WooCommerce backend.</p>\n<img />WooCommerce Activity Panel\n<p>The activity panel will also house a Notifications area that acts as an email Inbox. Developers will be able to add notifications from their extensions using the WooCommerce REST API endpoints.</p>\n<img />WooCommerce Notifications Panel\n<p>To see WC-Admin in action, you&#8217;ll need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/wc-admin\">feature plugin</a> and run it in a test environment. The WooCommerce team does not recommend using it in a production environment.</p>\n<p>Once it reaches beta, the plugin will be made available on WordPress.org to allow a larger audience to test it before being merged into WooCommerce core. The plugin is scheduled to hit beta in early 2019 with new features being merged in the first quarter of 2019.</p>\n<p>Similar to Gutenberg development where progress updates were published to the Make Core Developer blog every week or every other week, the WooCommerce team plans to publish progress updates every two weeks on its <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/\">developer blog</a>. With these improvements, WooCommerce is another reason for developers to learn JavaScript deeply.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 02:49:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"WPTavern: Learn How to Build an Interactive Prototype with Dave Martin’s Free JavaScript for Designers Course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84685\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wptavern.com/learn-how-to-build-an-interactive-prototype-with-dave-martins-free-javascript-for-designers-course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2439:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-1.23.18-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Product designer <a href=\"http://davemart.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Martin</a> has published a free video course called <a href=\"http://jsfordesigners.davemart.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript for Designers</a>. The course is made up of 46 bite-sized videos that walk students through the basics via a hands-on tutorial for building an interactive HTML prototype.</p>\n<p>Martin said he created the course specifically for designers who have been putting off learning how to code with JavaScript. He focused on concepts that are applicable to designers in their jobs, teaching skills that help them communicate to developers exactly how they want an app to behave.</p>\n<p>Coming from a designer&#8217;s perspective, Martin said most JavaScript tutorials are &#8220;dry and boring,&#8221; because they are written by developers. Ordinarily, these types of courses begin with JavaScript&#8217;s historical roots and progress from variables to arrays to objects, losing many learners along the way. Martin&#8217;s course is built more like a tutorial. Students will replicate some of the functionality found in a site like Dribbble. At the end, students should have a sufficient foundation of JavaScript that enables them to build an interactive HTML prototype.</p>\n<p>One of the other important ways this course is different is that the giant &#8220;Get Started&#8221; button on the page doesn&#8217;t take you to a registration form or make you sign up for dripped emails. It simply scrolls down the page so you can dive into the videos. Participants can download the code and follow along with the tutorial.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s announcement from WooSesh that WooCommerce is testing its new Javascript-driven interface is just another reminder that JavaScript is overtaking modern UI design and architecture. JavaScript knowledge is going to become increasingly in demand, and designers who have a decent grasp of it will land themselves higher paying positions. Even if you&#8217;re not a designer, Martin&#8217;s course may hold your interest better than traditional JavaScript beginners&#8217; courses.

Two weeks ago, Matthew MacPherson, who was named WordPress 5.0&#8217;s new accessibility lead, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposed the audit</a> and agreed to it being performed by an independent third party. The audit had gained strong support among accessibility contributors and others following the ticket.</p>\n<p>After soliciting detailed proposals from four companies, MacPherson has since rescinded the offer to coordinate the audit at this time and it seems he was unaware that he didn&#8217;t have the authority to authorize it in the first place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For at least the time being, Automattic has decided to forgo conducting an Accessibility audit on Gutenberg,&#8221; MacPherson said. He cited the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;an audit will not be actionable given our release timeline, because…</li>\n<li>the audit will not affect release timing, so&#8230;</li>\n<li>it would be more prudent to explore an audit on a less rushed timeline in the future&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>MacPherson apologized for &#8220;getting hopes up and then failing the community&#8221; on this particular issue. He is supportive of getting an audit but it is not a priority to complete before Gutenberg&#8217;s merge proposal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful we&#8217;ll explore an audit going forward, but unfortunately it will not happen before the merge proposal and thus I&#8217;m closing this issue as a won&#8217;t fix,&#8221; MacPherson said. &#8220;I would still like to blog about the state of Gutenberg accessibility, both the good and the bad. We&#8217;re making some improvements to keyboard navigation, color contrast, focus behavior, and date/color-pickers just this week.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those following the ticket were disappointed in the decision and several heated replies have been hidden and/or moderated. The issue has since been locked and unlocked several times since the announcement that Automattic has decided to forgo the audit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Literally every person with disabilities who has tested Gutenberg, both recently and at the outset, has flagged blocking issues as to why it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; Accessibility team member Amanda Rush said. &#8220;And user testing is just as important to accessibility as is WCAG 2.0 level AA compliance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because MacPherson said the decision came from Automattic, dissidents on the other side of the issue are saying that the company is acting in its own interests, as the decision was delivered without much explanation beyond an audit not fitting into Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gutenberg appears to be a commercially-driven add-on primarily intended for a8c’s benefit and should probably be treated as such by the community wherever that isn’t already true. <a href=\"https://t.co/c3yFImB5XL\">pic.twitter.com/c3yFImB5XL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Another Day, Another Doug (@zamoose) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zamoose/status/1052033672952598528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So disappointed in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/automattic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@automattic</a>’s decision to forego an independent accessibility audit for Gutenberg.

I plan to be an advocate, but I don&#8217;t set the timelines and I also don&#8217;t have solid data around accessibility. That&#8217;s the point of the audit: so we can speak from a place of hard data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An independent accessibility audit would have revealed whether the team&#8217;s current perceptions of Gutenberg&#8217;s lack of accessibility are accurate or inflated. It would also give the team&#8217;s new leadership the data he needs in order to make the most accurate recommendations regarding its readiness for the world. Kevin Hoffman advocated for pushing on with the audit regardless, in case WordPress 5.0 comes on a later timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The January 22, 2019 date would allow more than three months between today and the release of 5.0 to complete an audit and take action,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;The reasons above suggest that we cannot get an audit completed and significantly improve accessibility in three months time. If true, that is all the more reason to start the process now and respond to the audit by fixing as many issues as we can before 5.0 releases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea that the timeline will become less rushed after 5.0 (when it&#8217;s in the hands of real-world users who need it most) makes no sense at all.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As a blind <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> user &amp; sometime dev I really appreciate your work &amp; it is a real tragedy that the leaders of WordPress &amp; this project didn\'t build in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/a11y?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#a11y</a> from the very beginning &#8211; Any good team knows it is much harder to fix in hindsight</p>\n<p>&mdash; Dale Reardon (@DaleReardon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaleReardon/status/1049640723887185925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Absolutely this.

WordPress has always tried to get most of the way there on accessibility by sticking to common patterns and semantics, with the difference covered by key efforts of volunteers everyone on the Accessibility team doing testing and filing actionable bug reports. Gutenberg&#8217;s move to being an entirely JavaScript-based application has made it harder to apply those patterns, but we can work together to establish new patterns, a new baseline.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although there is no precedent for it, in this instance where Automattic&#8217;s perception of the editor&#8217;s accessibility differs wildly from that of the community, an outside audit might mitigate some of the conflict surrounding the issue.</p>\n<p>Pendergast said that despite best intentions and prioritizing accessibility, there is a possibility the Gutenberg team may not be able to deliver an &#8220;acceptable UX for assistive technology users by the time 5.0 is released.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;Despite the best intentions of everyone on the Gutenberg team, we haven&#8217;t done enough. I can honestly say that accessibility has always been a priority, but it hasn&#8217;t been a high enough priority, and we&#8217;ve done a poor job of communicating where accessibility has been improved. I mentioned some of those improvements in my earlier comment, but those improvements are of no benefit if we haven&#8217;t hit the baseline accessible experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The challenge of building in accessibility at the design stage, instead of retrofitting it after the fact, is one that WordPress is still struggling to get right in the Gutenberg era. Accessibility experts with React skills are few and far between, so it&#8217;s not easy to get fixes for all the issues testers are finding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some meetings we’ve discussed how to make accessibility integrated in the design process (design in its broader sense) since the beginning,&#8221; Accessibility specialist Andrea Fercia said during the team&#8217;s most recent meeting on Slack. &#8220;This is certainly an area were our communication and knowledge sharing should improve.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 22:16:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: First Look at The Twenty Nineteen Default Theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84808\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-nineteen-default-theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2272:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.allancole.com/\">Allan Cole</a>, a WordPress Theme Imagineer at Automattic has published the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/\">first glimpses</a> of the Twenty Nineteen default theme slated to ship with WordPress 5.0. Cole is leading the theme while <a href=\"https://kjellr.com/\">Kjell Regstad</a> who does Product and Editorial Design at Automattic will be a design coach.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img />Twenty Nineteen Blog Post Layout\n</div>\n<p>The theme takes a minimalist approach that&#8217;s a good fit for writers and can be adapted for simple business sites as well. Twenty Nineteen doesn&#8217;t have a sidebar but will have an area in the footer to display widgets.</p>\n<p>The theme will have full compatibility with Gutenberg when it&#8217;s released. It will also contain Front-end and Back-end editor styles. This will allow the presentation of content in the back-end to closely resemble how the finished product will look like. </p>\n<p>Twenty Nineteen is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/\">Underscores</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-starter-theme\">Gutenberg starter themes</a>. SASS is used to keep styles in-sync between Gutenberg and the front-end experience which Cole notes is, &#8220;not usual for a default theme and open to debate.&#8221; </p>\n<p>With WordPress 5.0 scheduled for a November release, Twenty Nineteen is on a fast track development cycle. A release candidate is expected to be available at the end of this month. </p>\n<p>To keep tabs on development, you can monitor the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">project&#8217;s GitHub page</a>. GitHub will be used to develop Twenty Nineteen until it&#8217;s ready to be merged into core. At that time, the GitHub page will be deprecated as development moves to WordPress Core Trac. </p>\n<p>Dev meetings that last a half-hour will take place every Tuesday at 12PM EDT in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-themes/\">#core-themes</a> Slack channel. It&#8217;s worth noting that if Twenty Nineteen is not ready in time for the planned November 19th, release of WordPress 5.0, it will be removed and released at a later date.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 02:45:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: ACF 5.8 Beta 1 Introduces Blocks Feature, Release Slated for November\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/acf-5-8-beta-1-introduces-blocks-feature-release-slated-for-november\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2092:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blocks.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: Adabo! <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34731278@N05/36299849102\">3d printed tetris blocks</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Advanced Custom Fields is now actively testing its new block creation feature in <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-5-8-introducing-acf-blocks-for-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ACF 5.8 beta 1</a>, released this week. ACF Blocks is a feature aimed at PHP developers who have not taken the deep dive into JavaScript yet. It essentially offers a shortcut to creating custom blocks using PHP and HTML instead of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that ACF Blocks is one of the more important features ever added to our plugin,&#8221; ACF representative Eric Karkovack said. &#8220;It levels the playing field and allows more developers to take advantage of Gutenberg’s key feature.&#8221; The feature was designed to allow WordPress developers who use ACF to maintain their current workflow for extending the editor.</p>\n<p>ACF Blocks allows developers to register a custom block type from a functions.php file. From there they can create a field group and use any ACF fields in the block. Rendering the block is the same process that&#8217;s used for displaying custom fields, with the notable addition of wrapping the HTML + PHP in a function.</p>\n<p>The ACF team plans to include the new blocks feature in version 5.8, which is anticipated to arrive in November.</p>\n<p>Creating custom blocks in this way seems like a stopgap measure for developers who haven&#8217;t had the time to learn how to extend Gutenberg before WordPress 5.0 arrives. This feature may be a useful abstraction for those who need to maintain their current workflow with ACF but it postpones the inevitable for developers who want to be truly proficient at extending the new editor. JavaScript skills will be required to properly understand what is going on under the hood.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 18:05:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Matt: The Importance of Meeting In-Person\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48528\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://ma.tt/2018/10/the-importance-of-meeting-in-person/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4207:\"<p>I recently returned from Orlando where Automattic hosted its annual Grand Meetup where nearly all of our 800 employees from around the world, spend a week together in the same place.

They plan to examine specific requirements once that information is available and will assist site owners in reaching compliance.</p>\n<h3>New Privacy Working Group to Facilitate Collaboration across Open Source Communities</h3>\n<p>At Drupal Europe 2018 a group of WordPress and Drupal contributors met to discuss the possibility of welcoming teams from major open source projects to work together on shared concerns. WordPress Privacy team contributor Heather Burns attended the first test run of the working group in the Open Source Lounge at the conference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the working group we have the big three &#8211; Drupal, WordPress, and Joomla &#8211; and we also spoke with representatives from the smaller projects like Neos and Typo3,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;We&#8217;re all dealing with similar issues but from different approaches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Burns said one of the goals of the working group is to push the idea forward that privacy is a common, positive, proactive value which can be taught and shared across projects. Members will discussion questions like whether privacy fixes belong in core or modules, how privacy notices pull information from different plugins and modules, and what laws are coming up that would require open source CMSs to build in some functionality in advance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way of pooling resources, code libraries, and briefings, as well as giving us a forum to share experiences,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;For example, we&#8217;re going to arrange for Drupal&#8217;s privacy lead to give a live video demo of their GDPR tools to our core group, and we&#8217;re going to do the same for them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The privacy working group is being set up through the Drupal community structure and members are in the process of coordinating some funding. More information on funding will be available in the next few weeks.</p>\n<h3>Privacy Contributors Seek to Change the Perception of Privacy to a Positive, Proactive Value</h3>\n<p>In addition to collaborating across the broader open source community, the privacy working group endeavors to educate their communities on the inherent value of privacy instead of simply focusing on the consequences of companies being forced to pay a fee if they don&#8217;t meet legal obligations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very keen to also shift the perception of what privacy is, and that it&#8217;s not just seen as being about negative legal obligations for GDPR, CCPA, etc.,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;We want people to think of privacy like accessibility: just the right thing to do for user protection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Burns speaks about privacy at WordPress and Drupal conferences and how projects can have differing cultural, historical, and legal approaches to privacy. Cultural barriers to the recognition of privacy as a core value is one of the privacy team&#8217;s biggest challenges in advocating contributions that respect and protect users&#8217; rights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m proudest of this year is helping people to understand each other better,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;We all come to the table assuming we share the same cultural, historical, and legal views of what privacy means and what role it should play, when the truth is there are wildly different views held even within project teams.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To paraphrase that awful quote, we don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know. What I do is help people to understand where we&#8217;re all coming from and what we don&#8217;t actually know. From there, I define what a healthy approach to privacy should involve outside reactive legal obligations, using a methodology derived from a number of international frameworks and treaties on privacy. It&#8217;s a matter of inspiring people to realize that as open source project contributors, we are people of enormous power and influence over privacy on the web. The actions we take within our projects, however small, can help to protect people from those who would use their data to hurt them. That&#8217;s the most important thing any developer can ever do.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:30:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Contributing to Gutenberg: A New Contributor’s Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84718\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/contributing-to-gutenberg-a-new-contributors-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7967:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img />\n</div>\n<p>The following is a guest post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisVanPatten\">Chris Van Patten</a> who shares his experience learning and contributing to Gutenberg. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk of Gutenberg&#8217;s higher barrier to entry for new contributors.  Van Patten is the founder of <a href=\"https://tomodomo.co\">Tomodomo</a>, a digital agency for magazine publishers. </p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<p>Over the past few months, but especially over the last few weeks, there has been extensive conversation about the barriers to entry present in contributing to the upcoming Gutenberg editor for WordPress.</p>\n<p>Of course, everyone&#8217;s experiences are subjective and unique. I can&#8217;t pretend to understand what everyone has felt. But my experience has been different than what some folks have been articulating, and I wanted to share my own take.</p>\n<h1>The Early Days</h1>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used WordPress for close to half my life; almost 15 years now. I remember some of the earliest versions of WordPress: the classic theme, the advent of Kubrick, MP6, up through today.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img />Early Days of the WordPress Backend\n</div>\n<p>Like many in the community, I&#8217;m entirely self-taught. I have no background in computer science, and have no formal instruction under my belt. I picked up code through trial-and-error, tweaking files and breaking my site as I wanted to make changes.</p>\n<p>Since those early days, WordPress was always my CMS of choice both for personal projects and for clients with my agency Tomodomo. But even though I had committed to the WordPress platform, my contributions back were limited.</p>\n<p>The rules, rituals, and etiquette around posting on Trac seemed arcane and illegible. To this day, I could not make an SVN patch if my life depended on it. And much of the core code, imbued with years of history and backwards compatibility, was hard for me to pick apart.</p>\n<p>So instead, I contributed in other ways: open sourcing simple custom plugins I was building, organizing WordCamps and meetups, and speaking at WordCamps around the globe. But it always bothered me that I couldn&#8217;t find a way to get those elusive &#8216;props&#8217;.</p>\n<p>(Okay, so I did actually get props on one release, but I am convinced it was a mistake; I had neither opened the ticket or provided a patch.)</p>\n<h1>Going… Going… Gutenberg</h1>\n<p>When I first learned about Gutenberg and started exploring, I was apprehensive. At first it seemed scary. My JavaScript abilities didn&#8217;t extend beyond jQuery. React was inscrutable and it seemed like I&#8217;d need a doctorate to understand some of the ideas behind it. I still don&#8217;t understand how Webpack works its magic. Does anyone, really?</p>\n<p>But the possibilities of the new block interface were too enticing to ignore, so I started diving in and figuring out how it worked. In those halcyon days (aka earlier this year), Gutenberg was still pretty rough around the edges, and there were a lot of opportunities for improvement. I started lurking on the GitHub repo, reading issues, examining the code, and generally trying to wrap my head around what the heck was going on.</p>\n<p>As I was playing around with Gutenberg for a client project, I started reporting issues: simple things, like user interface bugs. I started commenting on tickets, usually offering suggestions for a particular feature, trying to advocate from the perspective of independent developers.</p>\n<p>I even <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/6855\">filed my first pull request</a>! It was simple. I updated the README to include the day and time of the weekly #core-editor meeting (Wednesdays at 1pm UTC, if you&#8217;re wondering). It was an inauspicious beginning, but I was excited to get it merged.</p>\n<p>Over time, my knowledge grew. It was like my early days in web development, learning a CSS property here, and an HTML element there. I learned what a component was and how you could reuse them in different situations. I learned about JSX, and ES6, and some of the other crazy acronyms you encounter in Gutenland.</p>\n<p>As I was building more with Gutenberg, I was also finding new ways to <em>build Gutenberg itself</em>. I was able to understand more of the discussions, and offer my thoughts and suggestions. I started opening pull requests, largely dealing with design issues but also solving small bugs and quirks. I made a point of attending the weekly meeting I had previously added to the README, chiming in when I felt I had more perspective to share.</p>\n<p>Today I have 25 new issues and 27 pull requests under my belt, in addition to dozens of comments on existing tickets. I&#8217;m a &#8216;member&#8217; of the Gutenberg team on GitHub, and try to find time every day to triage new bugs or review pull requests. It took me most of the year to get to that point and it certainly wasn&#8217;t always easy. I still have so much to learn.</p>\n<p>When I hear about how difficult it is to contribute to Gutenberg, I can&#8217;t reconcile that with my own experience. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s a breeze: Gutenberg does things very differently than WordPress core, and there is undoubtedly a learning curve.</p>\n<h1>Advice for Contributing to Gutenberg</h1>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t comfortable coding from day one, there are so many other ways to contribute. Read through issues and add your own ideas and suggestions. Try testing and replicating bug reports. Hunt through inline documentation for typos and grammar corrections. All of these are valuable, and always appreciated.</p>\n<p>As you absorb the Guten-way through osmosis, you&#8217;ll find that the code isn&#8217;t as hard as you think — it&#8217;s just different. The intelligent people who build Gutenberg have done a great job at hiding away the &#8216;computer-science&#8217; bits so the rest of us don&#8217;t have to worry about data binding and other complex ideas. I still cannot explain state management, data stores, or context APIs but I have managed to find small areas of the code to improve.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to deny anyone&#8217;s frustration or confusion with Gutenberg and its development. Documentation is still lacking in many places. Some of the APIs are unintuitive. The tooling isn&#8217;t the simplest to set up. These are real problems, and I don&#8217;t want to pretend they don&#8217;t exist; we can undoubtedly do more to make Gutenberg development easier.</p>\n<p>And of course I have privilege to check: I&#8217;m lucky to have the time to spend in the GitHub repo, experimenting with code, and participating in weekly meetings. I recognize that&#8217;s not a reality for many people.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find the time, the Classic Editor will continue to be an option, and there&#8217;s no shame in prolonging the upgrade. It may take time for the Gutenberg experience to be as intuitive as we would all like it to be, and waiting for that is totally reasonable.</p>\n<p>But if you open yourself to some new ideas about what WordPress can be, and can make the time, you may end up surprised at how easy it is to contribute. If you get stumped, pop into <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-editor/\">#core-editor</a> or the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">forums</a>. Don&#8217;t be afraid to post a bug report or suggestion; we might consolidate it with another issue if it was previously reported, but the additional information is still valuable. Every experience matters.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m incredibly excited about the future of WordPress with Gutenberg and to finally be a real WordPress contributor. We have a long way to go, but that means there are still many exciting ways to make a difference. The project will only get stronger with more independent community voices chiming in.</p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join us!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 02:32:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: WordCamp for Publishers Seeks Host City for 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84683\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-seeks-host-city-for-2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1634:\"<p>WordCamp For Publishers&#8217; distributed organizing team is looking for a new host city in 2019.

The <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/wp-js-plugin-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress JavaScript Plugin Starter</a> is unique in that it is built as a tutorial, not just a boilerplate. The GitHub repo contains eight commits that have been structured to explain each step along the way. Benguella designed the repository to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I quickly setup a WordPress environment and how do I bake it into my plugin?</li>\n<li>How do I define a WordPress Plugin?</li>\n<li>How do I load a simple JavaScript script in WordPress?</li>\n<li>How do I bundle my JavaScript files?</li>\n<li>How do I use advanced JavaScript features like JSX?</li>\n<li>How do I build a production-ready version of my plugin?</li>\n<li>How does all this fit together?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Benguella predicts a shift in the WordPress development community, as JavaScript skills become essential for extending core&#8217;s rapidly evolving JS-based UI. Plugin architecture is changing to accommodate that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Plugin developers are required to use JavaScript more in order to extend the editor,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;Most blocks need to be developed using this technology. The modules Gutenberg provides (Components, data module, i18n, apiFetch…) will also encourage developers to extend other parts of WP-Admin in JavaScript. Instead of writing HTML/CSS screens from scratch and rendering them from the server, developers are able to bootstrap and prototype fully accessible new screens in WP-Admin by composing these components in a small number lines of code.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Benguella&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/wp-js-plugin-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress JavaScript Plugin Starter</a> resource demystifies the plugin creation process with detailed explanations of each step throughout the readme file.

The first <a href=\"https://2019.nordic.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Nordic 2019</a> is set to be held in Helsinki, Finland the weekend of March 7-8 at the <a href=\"https://www.paasitorni.fi/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paasitorni Congress Center</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some folks from the Norwegian community came up with idea in 2016,&#8221; lead organizer Marco Martins said. &#8220;Then in a WordCamp Stockholm we got people together and we discussed the idea. But it was earlier this year in WordCamp Jyväskylä (Finland) that we decided to commit to it and organize it. After that I went to Oslo to discuss personally with people from the Nordic countries and we came to an agreement. We gathered a team from the different countries and here we are.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The international organizing team is planning for approximately 600 attendees but the venue has the capacity for 800 people, if ticket demand is higher than expected. Paasitorni is an 111-year old complex brimming with historic significance. The Art Nouveau style building is also known as the Helsinki Workers&#8217; House, previously serving as leisure premises for the working class. It also provided the headquarters for the Red army during the 1918 Finnish Civil War. In the 1990&#8217;s it was remodeled to be a conference center and now includes a hotel and restaurants on premises.</p>\n<p>Finland has a stable and active WordPress community, which Martins said was one of the factors in the decision to host the first WordCamp Nordic in Helsinki. Regular meetups are held across the country in Turku, Tampere, Jyväskylä, Oulu, and Seinäjoki. The local <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WPHelsinki/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Helsinki Meetup</a> group has more than 900 members with average attendance of 20-60 attendees each month.</p>\n<p>Helsinki has hosted two previous WordCamps, both averaging more than 220 attendees. Three other WordCamps were held in Turku, Tampere, and Jyväskylä, along with an unofficial <a href=\"https://wp-metsa.fi/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Metsä</a> (&#8220;WP Forest&#8221;) in 2017, featuring cabins, lakes, outdoor tubs, sauna, and lightning talks by the fire. According to local organizers, Finnish camps have always sold out sponsor packages and tickets relatively fast.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Nordic will host a Contributor Day on March 7, followed by the main event on March 8. Organizers expect attendees from Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and other countries, with likely the most attendees from Finland. All the sessions will be conducted in English.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While Nordic countries have very close ties both culturally and historically, one of the challenges we often face when thinking of attending a local WordCamp in the region is language,&#8221; co-organizer Niko Pettersen said. &#8220;Even though most Finns learn Swedish in school, the language often stays at a basic level and doesn’t extend to technical things such as WordPress. By having all of our talks in English, we’re hoping to level the playing field and hopefully attract more people from all around the world to come and listen to what these communities have to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers are still in the process of discussing what topics they would like to see, but Pettersen said many Nordic countries tend to focus heavily on education, the environment, and healthcare. &#8220;Also with the EU Accessibility Directive coming to full effect in the coming years, I have a feeling a11y will be one of the major topics we will want to cover,&#8221; Pettersen said.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Nordic will also be hosting an informal Activity Day on March 9th where attendees will be welcome to join various activities, such as karaoke, cycling tours, trips to islands, and other other events coordinated by the community and sponsors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is something that Oslo has been doing informally the day after the camp and the feedback has been great so we thought it would be a good idea to have the activity day for people to do something together and experience something Finnish in more informal way,&#8221; Martins said. &#8220;We are planning the activities, but sauna for sure, because Finland.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One unique aspect of Finnish culture is the national obsession with saunas, and WordCamp Nordic organizers are ready to introduce attendees to Finland&#8217;s favorite pastime.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Traditionally saunas have been a place to cleanse the body and mind, but more recently travelers have discovered it is also a great place to meet locals, share experiences and get tips on where to go next,&#8221; Pettersen said. &#8220;If you’ve never been to one, I warmly suggest you extend your stay over the weekend as we’re planning on taking groups to some of the new public saunas in Helsinki during the Activity Day the day after the event.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Nordic Organizers Aim to Revitalize Local Communities by Fostering New Meetup Groups</h3>\n<p>Finland is the birth place of many open source projects, including SSH, MySQL, Linux, and IRC. WordCamp Nordic organizers hope to inspire that same spirit of collaboration among neighboring WordPress communities by hosting the regional camp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the goals we listed in our initial proposal was to focus on revitalizing the local communities in the region and help to form new meetup groups by getting the organizers and interested parties together during Contributor Day,&#8221; Pettersen said. &#8220;We saw our meetup scene grow in Finland from one to six in the space of a few years largely thanks events like these and good mentoring from the community at large.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers plan to keep the camp running in future years but have not yet settled on the selection process for future host cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As long as WordCamp Europe is organized during the summer, I have a feeling future events will be leaning towards spring/autumn or winter,&#8221; Pettersen said. &#8220;The selection process is still up for debate, but I imagine whoever feels like this is their calling will have the full support of the Nordic community to carry on where we left off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Nordic joins a small list of regional WordCamps that have become can&#8217;t-miss, enriching events for many in the WordPress community. Tickets will go on sale at the end of October.

To alleviate these misconceptions, Tiny published a <a href=\"https://go.tiny.cloud/blog/gutenberg-tinymce-faq/\">Gutenberg and TinyMCE FAQ</a> earlier this year.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>TinyMCE is used by the Classic Editor but as the FAQ explains, they are not one in the same and never have been. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The Classic Editor is <em>less</em> than TinyMCE in that it exposes just 6 of the 54 of the <a href=\"https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/\">official plugins</a> and a fraction of the UI. A popular WordPress plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/\">TinyMCE Advanced</a> created by Andrew Ozz exposes more of TinyMCE’s UI, core features, and plugins.</p>\n<p>The Classic Editor is also <em>more</em> than TinyMCE in that there is significant custom code in WordPress. This includes WordPress-specific UI components and backend code for embedding, links, media, and more. Some of the filtering code is specific to WordPress.</p>\n<p><cite>Andrew Roberts</cite></p></blockquote>\n<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Gutenberg uses TinyMCE to provide rich text editing and provides a Classic editor block that contains some UI elements from TinyMCE, but that&#8217;s about it. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Both projects have a close relationship but as Roberts <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/rich-text-editing-platform-tiny-raises-4m-launches-file-management-service/\">noted on TechCrunch</a>, the two are not mutually dependent on each other.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>&#8220;Tiny’s core business comes from a mix of software vendors, large enterprises, and agencies building custom solutions for clients that has little to do with the WordPress ecosystem,” Roberts told TechCrunch. “It is a popular and commercially viable project in its own right.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>While TinyMCE 5 features a brand new UI, earlier versions such as 4.7 were inspired by beta versions of Gutenberg.

During today&#8217;s core developer chat, Matias Ventura, the project&#8217;s technical lead, said he plans to post a full changelog and a video tomorrow. In the meantime, a call for testing 4.0 RC 1 has been posted to the make.wordpress.org/test blog with a list of 15 specific testing items highlighted for attention.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 4.0 introduces several new features, (including but not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add ability to change overlay color in Cover Image</li>\n<li>New Font Size Picker with clear labels and size comparison</li>\n<li>New RichText data structure to allow better manipulation of inline content</li>\n<li>Add Pullquote style variation and color palette support</li>\n<li>Add support for post locking when multiple authors interact with the editor</li>\n<li>Add support for shortcode embeds that enqueue scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A running list of the enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes is available on GitHub in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a>. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/deprecated/#4-0-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecations for 4.0.0</a> are outlined in the Gutenberg handbook.</p>\n<p>Grzegorz Ziółkowski has published Gutenberg&#8217;s npm packages this evening, so the team can move forward on core integration with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Accessibility has been one of the recent concerns with the project, as there are many outstanding <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAccessibility\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tickets</a> with this tag. One of the most prolific contributors to testing, Andrea Fercia, has stated that the editor in its current state is &#8220;barely usable&#8221; for those with accessibility needs. Joe Dolson, another WordPress accessibility contributor, wrote a <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2018/10/wordpress-accessibility-and-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reaction post</a> that concurs with Fercia&#8217;s assessment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The leadership within the Gutenberg project has not taken seriously the scope of accessibility problems in Gutenberg,&#8221; Dolson said. &#8220;I do not want to diminish the dedication to accessibility issues at some levels. The dedication to producing accessible content is still very high. But I’m not seeing dedication to developing an accessible authoring tool. It’s as if there’s no awareness of the needs of authors with disabilities; only consumers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If WordPress 5.0 is released on schedule, Dolson said he believes it is &#8220;almost a guarantee that the first release of Gutenberg in WordPress will not be accessible,&#8221; as there are too many major accessibility issues left to resolve.</p>\n<p>Matthew MacPherson, the new accessibility lead for WordPress 5.0, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318#issue-366539284\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he is willing to bet that Gutenberg is more accessible than the Classic Editor and that the perception of its inaccessibility is based on older evaluations of earlier releases:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think there&#8217;s a notion of Gutenberg being inaccessible because of older accessibility audits that identified a lot of issues in the very early versions. Things have changed a lot since the early days, and when the plugin was labeled &#8220;1.0&#8221; it was hardly a ready-to-ship product. I worry that many of those sentiments haven&#8217;t been re-examined and updated, so there is a prevailing idea that Gutenberg is not accessible or is entirely less accessible than the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;d venture is that Gutenberg is selectively less accessible, but overall more accessible feature-for-feature. Something like a date picker or a certain interaction being inaccessible does not make the entire editor inaccessible. Feature-for-feature, compared to a classic editor with similar capabilities (eg a bunch of plugins installed), I&#8217;d bet* Gutenberg is more accessible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite his suggestion that Gutenberg&#8217;s current accessibility issues are likely not as critical as contributors have claimed, MacPherson is willing to coordinate an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">independent accessibility audit</a> to get an outside opinion. Selection of the company to perform the audit is currently in process.</p>\n<p>After the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-lead-resigns-cites-political-complications-related-to-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">resignation of team rep Rian Rietveld</a>, accessibility contributors are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2018/10/09/suggested-agenda-for-meeting-on-october-15th/#comment-72719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">meeting next Monday</a> to get reorganized and discuss the leadership and decision processes of the team.</p>\n<p>Many have speculated outside of official channels on whether the recent shakeup in the leadership of the accessibility team is a referendum on the aggressive timeline for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in core or simply the natural turnover in open source projects when friction cannot be resolved. A truly independent accessibility audit, with results that are shared transparently to the WordPress community, will reveal whether current perceptions of Gutenberg&#8217;s lack of accessibility are accurate.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, a new &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Needs%20Accessibility%20Feedback\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Needs Accessibility Feedback</a>&#8221; label is available for use on the Gutenberg GitHub repository to facilitate communication between developers and accessibility contributors.

Once it is ready for use in production, the Asset CDN will be a new opt-in feature that can help speed up Jetpack&#8217;s 5+ million active installations.</p>\n<p>Version 6.6 also adds the necessary infrastructure for new Gutenberg blocks. The activity on the plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository indicates the team is <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/projects/14\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">working on a number of blocks for existing features</a>, including things like recipes, shortcodes, Jetpack subscription form, Simple Payments, Publicize, the contact form, tweet shortcode, VR shortcode, Giphy, and more. Everything touching the editor is in the process of being ported to blocks. Many of the blocks are already complete and some are still in progress. Some features, such as support for tiled gallery layouts, have bugs that need to be sorted before Jetpack will be ready for WordPress 5.0.</p>\n<p>Jetpack 6.6.1 will be going out soon to address a bug with social icons that this release introduced.

Their contributions have primarily been limited to testing and reporting issues. Rietveld said team members experienced frustration when they tested and improved functionality but saw it changed at a later stage, breaking accessibility requirements again. She also cites a lack of commitment to keyboard testing new features before implementation.</p>\n<p>Rietveld said she used her network to try to get more companies and developers with React skills involved in Gutenberg accessibility contribution. In March, tests they ran on the plugin revealed a staggering number of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAccessibility\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg accessibility issues</a> that remain unresolved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The results indicated so many accessibility issues that most testers refused to look at Gutenberg again,&#8221; Rietveld said. She included a statement from fellow contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/afercia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Fercia</a>, who has been highly active in testing Gutenberg functionality and reporting issues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While the Gutenberg team has worked hard to implement some fundamental accessibility features (e.g. focus management, navigate landmark regions), the overall user experience is terribly complicated for users with accessibility needs at the point the new editor is barely usable for them. </p>\n<p>The main reason for this lack of overall accessibility is in the overall Gutenberg design, where accessibility hasn’t been incorporated in the design process. </p>\n<p>Feedback from accessibility users has been constantly evaluated and Gutenberg is actually a regression in terms of accessibility level, compared to the previous editor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Gutenberg project now has a dedicated developer from Automattic, <a href=\"http://codinginairports.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew MacPherson</a>, who is working on accessibility issues and Rietveld said she hopes the core accessibility team will continue to offer him all the support he needs.</p>\n<p>Rietveld&#8217;s resignation is a major loss to the WordPress project. For years her leadership and contributions have demonstrated the project&#8217;s commitment to serving those with a disability.</p>\n<p>In 2016, she was instrumental in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress adopting accessibility coding standards for all new and updated code</a>. Rietveld was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributor-rian-rietveld-wins-heroes-of-accessibility-award\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recognized by Knowbility.org</a> as &#8220;a knowledgeable, dedicated, and effective advocate for accessibility in the global WordPress community,&#8221; whose achievements had a major impact on the application used by more than 25% of the world at that time. She took first place in the Individual Achievement category of the Heroes of Accessibility Awards.</p>\n<p>News of Rietveld&#8217;s resignation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RianRietveld/status/1049615192626253825\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roused an outpouring of sadness and gratitude on Twitter</a>. The WordPress community thanked her for her work and that of other accessibility contributors, whose efforts often go unappreciated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m not leaving WordPress nor accessibility, and in fact maybe now I can actually work on accessibility again,&#8221; Rietveld said. &#8220;I will keep giving talks and workshops. I also want to do research and work on tickets. But in my own pace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will join the a11y table if asked on contributor days, but maybe I’ll just go to a museum instead.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 16:27:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Alexis Lloyd and Riad Benguella Will Lead Phase Two of Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84550\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/alexis-lloyd-and-riad-benguella-will-lead-phase-two-of-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3856:\"<p>As activity ramps up to try to get WordPress 5.0 released in November, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/05/gutenberg-phase-2-leads/\">has announced</a> who will lead phase two of the Gutenberg project. Phase two focuses on Customization and entire site layouts. </p>\n\n<p>Alexis Lloyd, Head of Design Innovation at Automattic, will handle the design and product side. Riad Benguella, a JavaScript Engineer at Automattic, will handle the technical side of the project. </p>\n\n<p>One of the goals of phase two is to replace widgets with blocks and menus with a navigation block. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/05/gutenberg-phase-2-leads/#comment-34057\">Lloyd</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/05/gutenberg-phase-2-leads/#comment-34063\">Benguella</a> commented on the post, introducing themselves to the community. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Hi all! I’m thrilled to be working on phase 2 of Gutenberg,&#8221; Lloyd said. &#8220;I think there’s a huge opportunity to take the ease of use that has been brought to page/post editing in phase 1 and extend that to the full site experience. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m coming from many years leading design and product teams in news organizations (including designing and building custom CMSes), and am looking forward to bringing my experience to WordPress, as well as learning from the deep expertise in the community!&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Hi all! I’m so excited to be working with you all alongside <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/alexislloyd/\">@alexislloyd</a> to build upon the amazing technology that is Gutenberg in order to bring the content creation experience in WordPress to a whole new level,&#8221; Benguella said.<br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;For those who don’t know me yet, I’m a JavaScript engineer at Automattic. I’ve been fortunate to have contributed to the Gutenberg project since its beginning, including a lot of work on Gutenberg APIs, JavaScript in Core, and Accessibility.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I look forward to bringing my humble expertise to achieve the second phase of this project, as we look into things like widgets, menus, templates, and site-building in general.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h2>Theseus&#8217;s Paradox  Makes More Sense Now</h2>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-331-status-update-on-gutenberg-with-gary-pendergast\">episode 331 of WordPress Weekly</a>, one of the items we discussed with Gary Pendergast is the future of Gutenberg beyond the editor. At its core, Gutenberg is supposed to unify a number of areas of WordPress. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Blocks are the unifying evolution of what is now covered, in different ways, by shortcodes, embeds, widgets, post formats, custom post types, theme options, meta-boxes, and other formatting elements. They embrace the breadth of functionality WordPress is capable of, with the clarity of a consistent user experience.</p><cite>From the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg Plugin Page</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>I hypothesized that since Gutenberg is an interface to manage blocks and that menus as well as widgets will become blocks, the menus and widget management pages in the WordPress backend can be replaced or removed in favor of Gutenberg. </p>\n\n<p>In this way, the Menu and Widget management boards on <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/\">the Ship of Theseus </a>would be replaced without sinking or disrupting the entire boat. </p>\n\n<p>With Mullenweg&#8217;s announcement regarding phase two, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus\">Ship Of Theseus or Theseus’s paradox</a> begins to make more sense. Gutenberg becomes the foundation for bringing many areas of the WordPress project up to par without starting from scratch.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 01:52:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: Miami WordPresser Todrick Moore Passes Away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84545\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/miami-wordpresser-todrick-moore-passes-away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:928:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Todrick Moore Courtesy of <a href=\"http://davidbisset.com/todrick-moore/\">David Bisset</a></div>\n\n<p>Fellow WordPresser Todrick Moore, a member of the Miami WordPress community and volunteer organizer of WordCamp Miami 2015 and 2016  passed away last week of Leukemia.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Todrick Moore was one of the kindest and strongest members of the South Florida WordPress community, and I still to this day remember meeting him first at his local meetup,&#8221; David Bisset said. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Like many people who come to meetups he was eager to learn, but also as I would quickly come to realize, he would be eager to help others as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about Todrick and how to help out his wife with their <a href=\"https://www.madeinthemia.com/\">WordPress business site</a>, please <a href=\"http://davidbisset.com/todrick-moore/\">read this post</a> by David Bisset.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 00:24:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: How the Student-Owned Pelham Examiner Uses WordPress to Empower Young Journalists\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-student-owned-pelham-examiner-uses-wordpress-to-empower-young-journalists\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4229:\"<p>When the <a href=\"https://newsofpelham.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">News of Pelham</a> became another casualty of the blighted newspaper industry, student journalist contributors lost a platform for their voices to be heard. Their advisor, Rich Zahradnik, called a meeting to address the paper&#8217;s closure. More than a dozen middle and high school kids showed up and decided to start their own paper: <a href=\"https://www.pelhamexaminer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Pelham Examiner</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.richzahradnik.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zahradnik</a> is a former journalist who has been volunteering for years in the local elementary schools, teaching kids how to write news stories. Before the News of Pelham shut down he was acting as a liaison to recruit student contributors. He registered the Examiner as a corporation and the paper is also part of the New York Press Association.</p>\n<p>The Pelham Examiner is an online-only publication that covers everything from local politics and crime to sports and entertainment. It is running on WordPress, using plugins like All-in-One Event Calendar and WP Polls to enhance students&#8217; stories. The site uses the FLEX WordPress Theme by <a href=\"https://snosites.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SNO</a>, an organization that sells publishing solutions for scholastic news programs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screely-1539030523820.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress provided a cost-effective way to launch a student-run newspaper and students also found it to be intuitive for publishing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We chose to use WordPress mainly because of the ease with which we could use it and create a website look that worked for our goal,&#8221; Executive Editor Ben Glickman said. Zahradnik had used the platform with prior publications he had worked on with students at Colonial Elementary School.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Several of the students who had worked on The Colonial Times loosely remembered some aspects of WordPress, but most of us had to learn from the beginning,&#8221; Glickman said. &#8220;I started with the basics (creating new articles, saving drafts, etc.) and worked my way up to the more complex stuff.&#8221; Most students contributing to the Pelham Examiner didn&#8217;t require much training to get up to speed with publishing articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I thought that much of WordPress was rather intuitive, so learning was not too hard,&#8221; Glickman said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had any problems with WordPress so far. I&#8217;ve been especially impressed with how easy it is to integrate all kinds of story elements into a given story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Poynter published a <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/when-paper-they-were-writing-folded-kids-started-their-own\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> last week about the enthusiastic and highly motivated group of young journalists behind the <a href=\"https://www.pelhamexaminer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pelham Examiner</a>. For now the publication is self-sustaining with volunteer contributions, but Zahradnik told Poynter that he is open to ads or investors in the future.</p>\n<p>Sustaining the news as a business is another skill the students will need to learn as the publishing industry is increasingly demanding more creative revenue models from journalists who want to work independently. Zahradnik told Poynter that the Pelham Examiner&#8217;s student-owned online paper could be a model for other places that are no longer able to support traditional local newspapers.</p>\n<p>The News of Pelham was a bi-weekly, print-only publication before it closed its doors.

Holidays were considered because of the sharp drop-off in volunteer contribution activity. These versions were also part of a rigid and predictable four month schedule to get <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">three major releases out per year</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, WordPress 5.0 is no ordinary major release. It will contain Gutenberg and completely revamp the content creation and editing experience. Not to mention, we won&#8217;t know the full extent of plugin and theme compatibility until it&#8217;s installed on millions of sites. </p>\n\n<p>Looking at the proposed release date and <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> taking place on December 7th, it&#8217;s not out of the question to theorize the release occurring before and because of WCUS. It should be noted though that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare\">roadmap Matt Mullenweg outlined at WordCamp EU</a> earlier this year originally targeted a late August release.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be a bummer if WordPress 5.0 was not released before WordCamp US. However, it would be irresponsible as a project leader to force a release for public relations reasons.</p>\n\n<p>As Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-5-0-release-plan-estimates-release-candidate-to-ship-in-november#comment-262936\">commented</a> in a recently published article, he won&#8217;t release WordPress 5.0 until it&#8217;s ready. I don&#8217;t think releasing it to have a big moment on stage would qualify as being ready.</p>\n\n<p>I think there should be consideration in pushing the release date to the beginning of next year. What better way to ring in the new year with a completely new editor in WordPress. It bypasses the holidays concern and allows people to apply all of their focus on making sure 5.0 is rolled out smoothly to sites they manage.</p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg has been in development for more than a year and a half. Since the WordPress release strategy was thrown out the window last year and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/\">deadlines are not arbitrary</a>, what&#8217;s a few more weeks of development and testing before pushing WordPress 5.0 to the public?<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Oct 2018 03:09:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme and Plugin Shops are Pioneering the First Layout Blocks for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84351\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-and-plugin-shops-are-pioneering-the-first-layout-blocks-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5995:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/layout.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/EWENELMHYR\">Jeffrey Betts</a>\n<p>Many WordPress theme shops started out with themes as their only products but over the years have moved into selling plugins that enhance their core products. This came about partially because theming standards evolved to encourage developers to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-theme-developers-are-moving-functionality-into-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">put non-presentational functionality into plugins</a>. For many, the revenue from plugins quickly eclipsed that of their theme products. In the past, theme shops have often partnered with page builder plugins to enhance their users&#8217; capabilities in customizing the themes. This may soon change, as the advent of Gutenberg is bringing new product opportunities to theme and plugin shops shops.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the new editor focuses on blocks and the post editing experience. After Gutenberg is in core, the project will move on to the second phase &#8211; full site customization. This will venture into page builder type functionality. Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1037843717070057472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">predicts this phase will happen much faster than phase 1</a>, since all of the infrastructure is already in place. The plugin already has a columns block in beta.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is scheduled to debut in WordPress 5.0 in November, but site customization functionality won&#8217;t arrive until 2019 at the earliest. In the meantime, plugin developers have been experimenting with various implementations of &#8220;section&#8221; and &#8220;container&#8221; blocks while the Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explores a core container block</a> for phase 2.</p>\n<p>Marie Comet&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/MarieComet/WP-container-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Container Block</a> is a fork of the core columns block that offers columns structure, spacing, and backgrounds (with both image and color controls). Felix Arntz recently published a tutorial on how he built a <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/blog/building-a-reusable-gutenberg-section-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reusable Gutenberg section block</a>. Marc Lacroix created his own <a href=\"https://github.com/marcusig/gutenberg-section-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">container block</a>, out of necessity, with capabilities for spacing and background customization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-10.26.43-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Section/container blocks are a precursor to using Gutenberg for building more complex layouts. Some of these explorations may inform the Gutenberg team&#8217;s implementation of a core container block in the future.</p>\n<p>A few more full-featured layout blocks are starting to pop up on WordPress.org. Kadence Themes, a theme and plugin shop based in Missoula, Montana, released its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/kadence-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kadence Blocks &#8211; Gutenberg Page Builder Toolkit</a> at the end of August. The plugin brings the editor closer to delivering the features users expect from popular page builders, such as better control of columns for different screen sizes and a <a href=\"https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/row-layout-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">row/layout block</a> with controls for padding, backgrounds, alignment, and overlays with gradients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmtjc9lh6zA/\" title=\"View on Instagram\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://instagr.am/p/Bmtjc9lh6zA/media/?size=l\" alt=\"Instagram Photo\" /></a></p>\n<p>A live &#8220;Frontenberg&#8221; style <a href=\"http://demo.kadencethemes.com/kadence-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo of Kadence Blocks</a> is available where you can see the plugin&#8217;s options for manipulating page layout.</p>\n<p>Pootlepress, a WordPress plugin and theme shop, has added a new Layouts block to its free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caxton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Caxton plugin</a>. The company is one of the earlier Gutenberg adopters in the WooCommerce space with its recent release of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/pootlepress-previews-upcoming-storefront-blocks-plugin-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront Blocks</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>Caxton bills itself as a &#8220;page layout plugin&#8221; for Gutenberg. Its layout block allows users to select from a number of preset layouts and then add blocks within those layouts. It supports nesting rows and row backgrounds. A Frontenberg <a href=\"http://demo.caxton.pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo site</a> gives users the chance to play around with the page builder functionality before installing the plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"></div>\n<p>Until Gutenberg adds core support for more layout capabilities, WordPress may see an influx of these layout blocks that introduce basic page builder functionality. Some of these plugins may need to be refactored once there is more direction for these features in core, but they offer a glimpse of what Gutenberg will bring to site customization. Combined with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-9-introduces-reusable-exportable-templates-for-multiple-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.9&#8217;s reusable, exportable templates for multiple blocks</a>, page layouts will become more portable than ever.

The official release is targeted for November 19, 2018 with beta 1 expected October 19 and RC 1 released October 30.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting Gutenberg merged into core, the scope for 5.0 includes a few new items that Gary Pendergast outlined in his post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updating the default themes to work well with the block editor, and creating the new Twenty Nineteen theme.</li>\n<li>Creating an upgrade experience to remove the Gutenberg plugin and offer the Classic Editor plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>November 19 is the week of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when many are traveling or spending time with friends and family. As this is scheduled during a busy time of year and may have unexpected delays, the release leads have come up with a backup plan that includes a secondary schedule.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know there is a chance that 5.0 will need additional time, so these dates can slip by up to 8 days if needed,&#8221; Pendergast said. His post proposes an additional timeline that would have 5.0 land in January:</p>\n<p>Secondary RC 1: January 8, 2019</p>\n<p>Secondary Release: January 22, 2019</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current release date is November 19, but it can be pushed as late as November 27 if needed,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;To avoid the numerous holidays from the end of November through to January, we&#8217;ll move the release to January if more time is needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the backup timeline should allay concerns about December holidays, if the release is at all delayed, it will run up against the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Should we need to switch to the secondary dates, this will be communicated as soon as we’re aware,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;It’s also important to note that we have some updates for PHP 7.3 compatibility that must be released in 2018 regardless, and we would have a short 4.9.9 release cycle for them if needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors had the opportunity to ask questions of the release leads during today&#8217;s 5.0 kickoff meeting. There was some uncertainty in yesterday&#8217;s announcements about whether 5.0 will ship a new default theme. Matt Mullenweg confirmed that they are aiming to get Twenty Nineteen into 5.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest variable though, so if it takes longer we won&#8217;t delay the release for it,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Twenty Nineteen development will happen on GitHub and contributors can join the discussion in the #core-themes Slack channel where regular meetings will happen.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella posted a technical overview of the integration process for merging the new editor into core. He also laid out a plan for how Gutenberg development will continue in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After WordPress 5.0 is released, the Gutenberg plugin will continue to exist,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;Its purpose will be changed to the development and the maintenance of the WordPress npm packages, including the editor itself, and will also serve to develop the second phase (site customization) of the Gutenberg project. Plugin updates will continue to be released during the 5.0 cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PHP part of the plugin won’t be needed anymore, as the plugin will just register new versions of the scripts of the packages to replace the ones already registered by Core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg confirmed during the dev chat that the team plans to add a link to the Classic Editor plugin in the admin when 5.0 ships. Overall, contributors in attendance seemed excited about the prospect of finally having the new editor in core, despite the ambitious timeline proposed for release.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A big benefit even beyond the user improvements is that plugin and theme developers will be able to truly use it as a base in a way that they can&#8217;t right now as a plugin,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If previous adoption curves hold true, we&#8217;d be on 10m sites (20x current adoption) by new year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg development has been moving quickly and after it is shipped to millions of WordPress users there are bound to be more issues discovered. Mullenweg said quick point releases may be an option for maintaining the flexibility to introduce fixes and improvements in a timely way for users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since 5.0 will be very tight (just Gutenberg, PHP 7.3, and possibly theme) I am open to having 5.0.x releases that are like the 4.9.x releases that bring in some larger updates or improvements we push off, like servehappy stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura has outlined the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/26/an-update-on-gutenberg-tasks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tasks remaining on the editor</a>. An updated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">schedule for the 5.0 release cycle</a> is now available for the public to follow. Gary Pendergast, who is shepherding the merge, said he expects WordPress 5.1 will be available around March 2019.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 23:23:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sat, 03 Nov 2018 03:10:05 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sat, 03 Nov 2018 03:00:29 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130911040210\";}','no'),(140,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1541257805','no'),(141,'_transient_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1541214605','no'),(142,'_transient_timeout_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','1541257805','no'),(143,'_transient_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','<div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wordpress.org/news/2018/11/quarterly-updates-q3-2018/\'>Quarterly Updates | Q3 2018</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/github-rolls-out-more-small-improvements-as-part-of-project-paper-cuts\'>WPTavern: GitHub Rolls Out More Small Improvements as Part of Project Paper Cuts</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-336-interview-with-andrew-roberts-ceo-and-co-founder-of-tiny\'>WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 336 – Interview With Andrew Roberts, CEO and Co-founder of Tiny</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/how-to-add-an-image-to-a-paragraph-block-in-gutenberg\'>WPTavern: How to Add an Image to A Paragraph Block in Gutenberg</a></li></ul></div>','no');
